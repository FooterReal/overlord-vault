Originally the [[Old Gods|New Gods]], this is a religion which suffers greatly from the after effects of the [[Great Calamity]]. With them being the main target of the [[Great Adversary]], it was a shock to their followers as they began to fall.

The [[Old Gods|New Gods]] were once mortal men and woman who could not abide with how lazy the [[Wyr-Ones]] were. Beings of **Great Power** had a responsibility to use the power to benefit those around them. And so, [[The First Abyssal Expedition|30 men and women]] delved into the madness of the [[Abyss]] to draw out [[Maliagor's Heart|items]] which they would use to ascend to godhood.

Unfortunately for them, despite their prodigious skills and powers, they found themselves unprepared for what awaited them within that nightmare and only 8 walked out of there with their lives. But with them followed their prize. Using the [[Maliagor's Heart|item]] which they had pulled from the [[Abyss]], after ensuring it was purified, they were infused with glorious power, ascending them to the point of godhood.

For a time, their more proactive stance upon godhood earned them adoration and worship. However, when the [[Great Adversary]] began to cut them down one by one, people's faith began to waver. In the end, there only remains two [[Old Gods]] which remain awakened and walking upon the land. Their grandstanding has all but been stolen from the [[Eternus]].

While 4 remain dead from the [[Great Adversary]], two others remain alive even if they are in critical condition, left deep within their temples with only faith and magic to keep them alive. Regardless, it seems that they refuse to drop their ideals, giving out miracles even when they are unable to stand under their own power.
