The first surviving [[Old Gods|Old God]] is [[Amon]], Lord of Glory. A god which bestowed his power upon those who'd bring glory and honour upon themselves. A **brash** man who calls for people to act with dignity. Glory does not come to those who brings ruin upon their fellow man. Instead, glory comes from rising above such things and showing your abilities to be unmatched through your own efforts.

It is by his grace, even despite their actions weakening their religion's standing, that [[Aurora|The Prophet of the Eternus]] lives even today for he granted them [[Immortality|immortality]] as a reward for slaying the [[Great Adversary]].
