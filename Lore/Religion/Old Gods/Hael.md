The Second of the Remaining Old Gods is [[Hael]], Lady of Combat. With unmatched prowess, she single-handedly held off the [[Great Adversary]] during the final days of the [[Great Calamity|Calamity]], granting time to finally crush them once and for all. Her focus lies upon combat and innovations in making it more nuanced. 

Fighting and Battle is not to be some dirty thing where you roll around in the mud attempting to land a knife to the throat. It is to be a spectacle to behold between people who can properly wage war rather than whatever scrap you pull out in desperation.
