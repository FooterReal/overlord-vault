God of [[Fate]] does not control or craft the designs of men but instead weaves possibilities. Entwining souls who have finished their [[Cycle of Reincarnation]], the [[Fate|God]] grants them a fate which they'll find they have an easier time walking upon. Some do not find their calling and others ignore it entirely, and this doesn't tend to have consequences outside of the person's own choices which has built their faith. Most temples to him tend to speak positively of embracing the chance the [[Fate|god]] has granted. Those [[Brand|Branded]] by [[Fate]] can borrow the Fates of those around them, making them often team players within the group of [[Hero|Heroes]], capable of preforming mind shattering feats but only with the proper support of those around them.
