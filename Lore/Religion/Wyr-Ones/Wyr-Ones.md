The very first [[Gods|gods]], and the ones who stood before anything had come to pass. The [[Wyr-Ones|Wyr]] are not like the [[Old Gods]] or the [[Eternus]], instead, they are forces of nature rather than beings. While they do grant blessings, it is truly difficult to differentiate between their efforts and natural occurrences. 

The power of the [[Wyr-Ones|Wyr]] is by no need insignificant though, and those who channel the power of the [[Wyr-Ones]] will find their attunement to the world enables them to do unmatched feats of power. But it is a slow process and one which demands constant diligence lest [[The World|the world]] overwhelms the user. This has only become more dangerous and unstable with the damages inflicted onto [[The World|the world]] by the [[Great Adversary]]. 

While they had their time, their lack of presence alongside their seemingly lacking benefits led to the short age of the [[Old Gods]], whose direct influence and visible might led to the beginnings of the abandonment of the [[Wyr Way]]. This was only exasperated as time continued on. The consequences of the [[Great Calamity]] weakened these great beings and the [[Eternus]] were an even more appealing option to stand behind.

Nowadays, worship of the [[Wyr-Ones]] is rare. Only small patches of the religion exist nowadays and some even consider it to be the only religion who has had all their gods slain, with their followers in denial of the fact.
