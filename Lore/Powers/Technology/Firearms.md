[[Firearms]]. The idea of a weapon which is easily able to kill a man with minimal training. Take the idea of a crossbow and improve upon it. It was supposed to be a simple concept. However, [[Firearms]] have proven themselves to be simply too bothersome to mass-produce for common use.

Mass-production for [[Firearms]] is effectively bottle-necked by [[Hael]], as she disapproves of the idea of making combat less honorable and glorious. A bunch of peasants murdering each other in fields is something she will not allow. Furthermore, simply making [[Firearms]] is a pain in the ass for most smiths, requiring tools and materials that are far outside of the norm. The would also need to go through extensive training to be able to make the pieces consistently and to be able to assemble them.

As such, [[Firearms]] are not a common sight. Beyond that, they tend to not be very effective against anything truly threatening. However, some mages take a keen interest and work to make them more effective. Most [[Firearms]] nowadays have the most bare-bone enchantments on them, even people who’ve never used magic before are capable of placing them. The enchantments make the weapons barely acceptable for seasoned [[Gunslinger|gunslingers]].

However, while for most, [[Firearms]] tend to be incredibly basic enchantment wise, those who wish to truly get some bang for their buck can go further beyond. Some mages use them as amplifiers to their spells while other people simply make them hit harder and become more accurate.

While more advance models of [[Firearms]] may exist here and there, you should expect to find flintlock weaponry as your items of choice. 

[[Firearms]] require training to use properly. If your character would have a logical reason to have proficiency with firearms, you may take it when making your character. However, you must give away a proficiency of your choice to do so.

New Item Traits:
- **Matchlock:** A weapon which is a matchlock fires at the end of the round rather than being fired immediately.
- **Reliable:** Once a day, when you misfire the weapon, it doesn't jam.
- **Unreliable:** When you misfire within the number next to Unreliable, your gun immediately breaks instead of just jamming.
- **Long Reload:** A weapon which has long reload requires a number of actions to reload equal to the number next to it.
- **Headshot:** A [[Firearms|firearm]] which has the headshot properly is extra precise. If you roll above the target’s AC with an amount equal to the number next to the trait, it deals an extra dice of damage and triggers the brutal property.
- **Amplifier:** This weapon can be used as a spellcasting focus and can be used to modify your spells’ effects in a minor way.
