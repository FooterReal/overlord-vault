The [[Weave]] is a standardizing factor for [[Magic]] by allowing one to channel it to assist in casting spells. But that's where elder practitioners would notice something strange. For the [[Free Magic|magics of old]] did not rely upon spells, instead working purely upon the imagination and magical power of the caster.

One might think that such a limiting factor would mean [[Magic]] is now worse, but that isn't necessarily true. The act of **Weave Casting** is indeed inherently more restricting and less creative, but it's also comparably much simpler and tends to be a much less tiring method of [[Magic]].

Beyond that, spells can be introduced to the [[Weave]] by skilled mages, which it seamlessly adapts into its 'arsenal.' 

For those looking for power, there were those willing to continue the research into the [[Weave]] and forge a method to make it even more stringent. While **Weave Casting** requires its fair share of sacrifices, this method of casting, called [[Mana Channelling]].

Moreover, the [[Weave]] goes even further than just arcane magic. Most blessings of [[Magic]] by deities tend to be of **Weave Casting** simply due to the fact that it's much more cost effective to do so. The [[Weave]]'s power being so great that it even is capable of assisting divinity.

And then there are the two outliers. Both [[Abyssal Magics|Abyssal]] and [[Eldritch Magic]]. Two sides of the same coin, these types of magic tend to be devastating to both the targets and the casters. However, the backlash comes in different forms. [[Abyssal Magics|Abyssal Magic]] drains the body to fuel its destructive power while [[Eldritch Magic]] tends to ravage the mind of the caster. 

While only certain arts of [[Abyssal Magics]] are considered [[Forbidden Magics|forbidden]], it's not a style of casting which is very popular or well received. [[Eldritch Magic|Eldritch Magics]] however, are completely outlawed.

All Magic Casters may choose a type of casting they are talented with. While you can still learn other casting styles, you will never be as proficient in them.

All Magic Casters know **Weave Casting** even if they are not proficient in it.

Most Casting Styles can evolve over time and you will begin as a novice of your chosen style.

You may choose one of the following:
- **Weave Casting** - With more skills in Weave Casting, you can manipulate it longer than others without exhausting your reserves. You gain a Cantrip for your class or the closest class to yours if you do not have Cantrips. You also gain an additional 1st-level spell slot.
- **Free Magic** - Your spell slots are turned into spell points and you use the Spell Point variant rules. However, all your spell costs are increased by a number equal to the spell's level.
- **Mana Channelling** - When Mana Channelling, all levelled spells that you cast count as being a level higher than normal. However, to use this style, you must pick which spell each of your spell slots will cast when you gain them.
- **Abyssal Magic** - You will be granted a random Abyssal Cantrip and can learn Abyssal Spells.
- **Eldritch Magic** - You gain a vulnerability to psychic damage. You will gain a themed first level Eldritch spell and Cantrip after picking a P̴̆̒a̷͛̇ẗ̴́́r̴̈́̈́o̸͌̄n̶̑̕.
