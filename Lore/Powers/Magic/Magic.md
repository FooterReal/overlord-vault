The lifeblood of [[The World|the world]] itself. It is something which is seeped in each and every living thing and is a sign that you are alive, even if you are unable to harness it.

The Terror of the battlefield. It brings untold destructive power into the hands of anyone who is willing to learn it, causing extreme destruction and death. 

Both of these are true. Long ago, [[Magic]] users were said to be rarer and more wild than today, but as the [[Imperial College]] will teach, that is simply not correct. [[Magic]] is something anyone can harness, even if they do not have much talent or affinity for such a thing. But what changed was simply the method.

While much of history and knowledge was destroyed in the [[Great Calamity]], the [[Old Gods]] aren't entirely adverse of speaking of the past, and upon the matters of [[Magic]], they had much to share.

Long ago, before the [[Great Calamity|Calamity]] and when the [[Old Gods|Eight]] were referred to as the [[Old Gods|New Gods]], There was a war waged between their followers and the [[Wyr-Ones]]. A great sage of the time had found how difficult it was for new apprentices to learn the ways of the old magics from him. So he decided to take matters into his own hand. Sacrificing his own life, he created the [[Weave]], a weapon of [[Magic]], although in a unconventional way.
