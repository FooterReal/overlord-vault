The results of the slashes against the [[Old Gods]] by the [[Great Adversary]]. These spots across [[The World|the world]] ooze with [[Magic|magical]] power which an experienced [[Adventurer|adventurer]] can use to empower themselves greatly. However, taking in the mixture of [[Magic]] of a [[Gods|god]] and someone as powerful as the [[Great Adversary]] is incredibly risky, leading to more than likely hurting yourself in the process.

While within a [[Divinity Zones|Divinity Zone]], all creatures, upon using a resource such as a class feature or a spell, can choose to try and fuel the ability using the power left within the [[Divinity Zones|Divinity Zone]]. 

Chosen abilities are broken into 3 types of categories.
### 1. Major Features 
These are class features or abilities which can cause a major change in battle. Features that'd fall under this category would be Actions such as **Action Surge** or **Rage**. 
#### Failure
Failure to successfully harness [[Divinity]] for this will either:
- lower your maximum HP by `20%` until you take a long rest or
- cause you to gain `2` levels of exhaustion. 

The starting DC for this is `20`. Passing this save increases all channelling DCs by `5`.
### 2. Minor Features
These are smaller and less impactful abilities to the class or subclass's overall core identity. Most other resource abilities will fall here. 
#### Failure
Failure to successfully harness [[divinity]] for this will either:
- lower your maximum HP by `10%` until you take a long rest or 
- cause you to gain `one` level of exhaustion. 

The starting DC for this is `15`. Passing this save increases all channelling DCs by `3`.
### 3. Spells
A spell's backlash will work differently compared to the above two. The spell's level will dictate how punishing it is to fail to harness the power. 

#### Failure
Failure to successfully harness [[divinity]] for this will either:
- lower your maximum HP by `(3 * X, rounded to nearest 5%)` until you take a long rest or 
- cause you to gain `(X / 3, minimum of 1)` level(s) of exhaustion

The starting DC for this is `13 + X`. Passing this save increases all channelling DCs by `X / 2`.
Where `X` is the spell's level.

# ---
When you make the constitution saving throw, you will also add your level to the roll. The increased DC will lower by 5 after a long rest. After level 10, you auto pass your first minor feature recharge without increasing the DC.

While recharging is the most common method of using a [[Divinity Zones|Divinity Zone]], that doesn't even scratch the limit of what may be possible within them. (You can try and pull things you normally never could in one of these zones. The penalties for doing so will still apply.)

If an anti-magic zone is cast within a [[Divinity Zones|Divinity Zone]], [[Magic]] will still function within it. However, the present [[Divinity]] can no longer be used.
