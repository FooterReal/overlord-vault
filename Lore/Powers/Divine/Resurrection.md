With the [[Cycle of Reincarnation]] taking souls and not leaving them available to return from the afterlife, the effectiveness of most revival spells have been lowered or changed. 

All Resurrection spells other than True Resurrection are now a level higher. 

Reincarnate has had its level dropped to 3 instead. 

Raise Dead has had its resurrection time reduced to 4 days. 

Resurrection has had its maximum time reduced to 3 months, with anything being dead for longer than a month inflicting the normal penalties.

Reincarnate now has a time limit of a month. When cast, the soul is forcefully sent through the [[Cycle of Reincarnation]] at high speeds in a attempt to try and avoid the worst of it. The target of the revival will more than likely lose memories and skills, with the effects being worse each time Reincarnate is cast upon them. If the God of [[Death]] catches this fast tracking, the soul will be torn from the spell. This is considered [[Forbidden Magics|forbidden magic]]. 

True Resurrection works as long as the soul has not finished getting reincarnated at no risk.
