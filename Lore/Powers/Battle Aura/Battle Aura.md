[[Magic]] is an advantage which could change the field of battle in an instant. It is something most [[Beastman|beastmen]] lack the ability to manipulate and use. While they still do have [[Magic]] within their body, it's difficult for a [[Beastman|beastmen]] to properly benefit from this. Such a thing has long since left them at a disadvantage and so a solution would need to be found.

So rather than channelling the power of [[Magic]], they attempted to go even deeper, working off the very [[Soul|core]] of their being in order to power themselves and counter said [[Magic]]. It was a gruelling effort, but using the nature of one's soul in order to become a physically more capable combatant was proven to be very effective. Using this power, they would make great strides in becoming more powerful. 

Eventually [[Trael]] stole the techniques used and developed [[Battle Aura]] for themselves. This would eventually lead to the knowledge being more widespread.

[[Battle Aura]] is the accumulation of one's [[Soul]] and [[Will]], forced into a physical boost of power. At least initially. The longer one trains it and harnesses the power, the more it will begin to shift and shape into something more specific to the person themselves. The [[soul]] will make it's mark known, even if one tries to struggle against it.

At the beginning, a character with a martial class will have the simplest form of [[Battle Aura]]. 

As a bonus action you can channel your [[Battle Aura]] to enhance your combat prowess. You gain **5+level** temporary hit points and your aura becomes active for a number of turns equal to your **proficiency bonus**. While the aura is active, you deal 1d4 extra damage on all attacks and can get advantage on any one saving throw of your choice.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **proficiency bonus**, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

As your character grows in power and level, they will slowly begin to branch out into their own unique and powerful variations. However, this requires both time and training to achieve its complete state.
