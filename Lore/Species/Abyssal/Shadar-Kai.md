## Description

Rather than being changed by the energies of the ~~Shadowfell~~, instead, the [[Shadar-Kai]] have been changed by the energies of the [[Abyss]], granting different benefits.

(Lose the **Fey Ancestry** trait. Shadar-Kai have advantage dealing with artifacts from the [[Abyss]] and the [[Abyss]] itself. They have disadvantage against saving throws which deal radiant damage.)
