You can play as a [[Hybrid Race]] with [[Demon]] and [[Beastman|Beastmen]]. 

It is absurdly rare for a Demi-Demon to live past the early stages of their life and their soul will be made malformed. They make all rolls (checks, attacks, saves) related to healing or channelling the soul with disadvantage while any attacks against them have advantage. 

To play a hybrid, replace one feature from one of the parent races with another from the other parent race. These traits must be roughly similar in power. 

The following races are considered Beastmen Hybrids already:
- Shifters
- Yuan-Ti
- Merfolk
