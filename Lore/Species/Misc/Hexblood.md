[[Hexblood|Hexbloods]] are created in a intrinsic ritual that are usually only known to [[Witch Coven|witch covens]]. Should the one who created them die, they lose their powers. You may not start as a [[Hexblood]] and its racial bonuses will stack upon whatever race you are, except for ability scores. You do not count as **Fey** and your **Fey Resilience** trait is renamed **Hexed Resilience**.
