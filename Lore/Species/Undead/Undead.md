The following species are creations of [[The Fourth Overlord]]:
- [[Vampire]] - Feared and reviled as all undead are.
- [[Dhampir]] - While not as disliked as vampires, are still not treated the best.
- [[Reborn]] - While they are not considered a threat, those who worship the god of [[Death]] do not particularly like them.

Other undead creatures also exist, such as mindless undead (zombies, skeletons, etc.) and:
- [[Dracolich]]
- [[Lich]]

Undead do not have a [[Fate]].
