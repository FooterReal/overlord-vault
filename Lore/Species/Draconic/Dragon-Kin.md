## Description

Long Before the [[Great Calamity|Calamity]], the [[Dragon-Kin]] were a prosperous and mighty race. However, those times have long since passed. The [[Great Adversary]] decreed them a target to be wiped out, alongside their [[Dragon|Progenitors]]. And they made good upon that choice as most lands including this once mighty race were burned to ash.

Nowadays, the sighting of a new [[Dragon-Kin]] is extremely rare. For [[Dragon|dragons]] who remember the old ritual to create the [[Dragon-Kin]] have long since died out and the [[Dragon-Kin]] still alive do not know it. All they can do is rely upon natural birthing now, which often does not have the child's [[Draconic Power|draconic]] nature take root.
