The existence of the [[Aurora|True Prophet]] was something that nobody saw coming during the end of the [[Great Calamity]]. To many, it was the end of times, with even the [[Gods|gods]] falling to the brutal strength of the [[Great Adversary]]. To suddenly find that not only had the [[Great Adversary|Adversary]] been struck down, but by the priestess of an entirely new religion was a shock, but one that did not detour people from rushing to join the word of the [[Eternus|gods]] she preached of.

Speaker of the [[Eternus]] and guide of humanity, [[Aurora]] is the most influential person within [[The World|the world]], towering even over kings. And it’s little wonder why. She is the first and greatest [[Hero|hero]] known to history, having not only slain the [[Great Adversary]], but also leading the first band of [[Hero|heroes]] in their task of slaying [[The First Overlord]].

She is powerful beyond reckoning, with some even whispering of her being truly capable of ending the [[Old Gods]] should she wished to try. Yet she tends to stay outside of conflicts between people, only focusing her efforts on outsider threats and those who’d abuse the authority of [[Eternus' Church|the church]] for their own whims.

[[Aurora]] is a rather personable person despite her status, tending to spend her time frequently among other people. She has a calming demeanour, one which usually tends to be taken as comforting. Although one must wonder how attached to her humanity she truly is after so many years, even despite her rather agreeable personality.
