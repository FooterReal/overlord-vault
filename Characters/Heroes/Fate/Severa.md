A simple maid. That’s the facade that has fooled hundreds of people. And it’s little wonder why it would. The one who hides behind the role plays it unfathomably well, to the point she is more well trained than even the real maids at the castle.

In truth? This maid is the notorious assassin, [[Severa|Bloodhound]]. Attempting to slay the ‘perfect’ [[Julius|prince]] for the largest payday she had ever seen, she was unprepared for the surprise [[Julius' Dragon|Frost-Wyrm]] which laid in wait for her arrival. She was then forced into the services of the [[Greyhold Crown|royal family of Greyhold]] in order to retain her life and her disguise. A personal servant for the one she tried to kill.

Begrudgingly she agreed to do the dirty work for these people. It’s not as if she had any other choice. An expert in the killing of men, she had no means upon her that’d even harm a [[Julius' Dragon|Frost-Wyrm]] of all things. So she’d do as they say, keeping up an act of the proper and prim maid who got luckily enough to catch the [[Julius|Prince]]’s eye with her talents. And this is where she’s destined to stay…
Or at least, that’s how her fate will be if she is not [[Brand|Branded]] by [[Fate]] himself. Should she be [[Brand|branded]] by [[Fate]], she will eagerly take her chance to slip her leash. After all, no matter how honoured they are, nobody is allowed to restrain a hero from undergoing the task of slaying the [[Overlord]].

In terms of hunting monsters, [[Severa]] isn’t anything special. Forced to rely on ranged solutions due to her close quarters fighting styles being specifically developed for people, she won’t be winning any awards.

But for people? She is one of the most lethal combatants one could ever see. By her own words, any fights she’s walking into without her target being poisoned or weakened is one she messed up. Dirty tricks are her forte and any method available to her to kill another man will be used without any hesitation to be had.

Ironically, while she is no doctor, her intense anatomy knowledge of all humanoids does mean that even if she is unable to be counted as a proper healer, she is more than capable of patching up injuries just with the knowledge necessary for her to know where to stab to kill someone faster.

[[Severa]] will slip into any party just fine, fully capable of placing a mask upon herself that will get along however she needs with them. But [[Hero|Heroes]] who have a more perceptive eye will slowly begin to pick apart her act until eventually, she will have no choice but to reveal her true self. A bitter and self hating woman who is self destructing on herself in her quest to finally kill the one who took everything from her.

>“So this is who I’m working with. Interesting. It is a pleasure to meet you all. May our quest continue with good fortune.”
