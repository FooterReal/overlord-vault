Upon the [[Table of Fifteen]], [[Aegle]] stands as one of the two blessed by the [[Cosmos]] in being blessed with divine might and power. Magnificent power flows through his veins, capable of feats of violence that’ll surpass any of those who stand at the [[Table of Fifteen|table]], even their leader…. or so the rumours say. In truth, [[Aegle]] is what you’d call passable with a weapon, even though he is indeed blessed by the [[Cosmos]].

For [[Aegle]] is not one for fighting. He certainly can, he wouldn’t have his position if he couldn’t, but he’d much rather settle things through talking than resorting to fisticuffs. And even then, unless necessary, he’d rather not draw his weapon himself. As for him, it’s much more preferable to not have to kill others due to his rather uncomfortable feelings over the murder of sentient creatures, so he usual sticks to supply support.

And luckily for him, he’s fully capable of doing just that as he’s been blessed with the power to bolster his allies. He does not often need to step in himself due to being able to both heal and increase the might of those around him with prayer and incantations. Empowered strength, increased durability, enhanced skills. All these options and more linger in his hands. But all of this pales at his most powerful ability of all.

Being a genuinely good person, [[Aegle]] is someone with grand ambitions in his heart and those ambitions all involve helping people. Despite the [[Eternus' Church|church]]’s attempts at helping those in need, they can’t do everything at once. Which is why he is often out in the field, doing what he can to make people’s lives better in whatever way he can. Coin doesn’t matter to him, so he’ll throw as much as he needs to at a problem if it’ll help things get moving faster.

He has built up a astounding amount of good will with various people throughout his life with his good deeds. And should he be [[Brand|branded]] to go slay the [[Overlord|overlord]], these people won’t stand idly by and let his favour go unpaid. The [[Current Heroes|Heroes' Party]] will be getting far more support than they normally would due to his friends in high places, low places, and everywhere in between.

>“Hail there friend! You too have been chosen by the [[Eternus]], yes? Wonderful. It is my pleasure to greet you to the cause.”
