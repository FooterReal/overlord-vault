Who would question the [[Eternus]]’ decision of champion? Most would refuse the thought entirely but in this case…perhaps there is an exception to be made. For there are limits to how far one is willing to suspend their disbelief and this may be the limit.

This [[Elf|elf]] is a blatant worshipper of an [[Eldritch Gods|eldritch god]]. She makes no effort to conceal her alignment with those blatant evils and yet the gods may have chosen her to stand as the one [[Brand|branded]] by [[Fate]]. Such a thing would be unprecedented, and that fact is one which would cause **Major Suspicion**.

But [[Zephia]] frankly doesn’t care about any of them. They aren’t important in the grand scheme of things. Keeping to herself about any details of her past, the [[Elf|elf]] will go about her duties as the one [[Brand|branded]] by [[Fate]] with her full efforts.

While her story is unknown by all, her prowess is rather obvious. Debilitation of the mind is her bread and butter for an assault as the tentacles surrounding her strangle her foes to death. But more importantly is her capabilities for healing. While clearly some pagan and heretical [[Magic|magics]], it’s effectiveness can’t be denied. Closing up lethal wounds with simply a couple of moments of concentration and even bringing back the dead with more effort, it’s as if death has no hold over anyone she chooses to save.

She’s more of a listener than a talker and tends to be rather snarky in her responses but she is by no means unpleasant company, odd eldritch quirks excluded. However, should someone take the plunge and ask her about her [[Zephia's God|god]], she will speak adamantly and excitedly, even offering to allow them to hear his voice themselves. Unsurprisingly, not many are willing to take her up upon that offer.

>“You can feel them, yes? Even with so much effort to prevent otherwise, the pressure of [[Zephia's God|my lord]] can be felt even here.”
