The [[Demon|demons]] of the [[Eastern Lands|Eastern Isles]] are far different than the ones which roam the [[Mainland]]. [[Yokai]], creatures of malevolence and destruction. Consumed by their nature, they rampage across the lands of the [[Eastern Lands]] and cause no small amount of trouble. Yet, for all of their issues, many of them are not regarded as much of a true threat. 

This is not true for [[Yokai]] who hold great intelligence and are not a slave to their instincts. And while not a destructive powerhouse like the [[Gashadokuro]] or [[Tengu]], [[Kitsune]] are no exception for this. Tricksters at best, and active malevolent web weavers at worst, it’s nearly impossible to truly catch an experienced [[Kitsune]] at work weaving their craft.

For some, they are content simply ambushing those who take the roads, causing problems and stealing their things. But others have grander ambitions, as the story of a certain legendary [[Kitsune]] would prove. Taking on human shapes and forms, they infiltrate all manners of towns and cities to mingle and play with the people who live there. Due to their potential and threat rising as they gain more tails, any [[Kitsune]] not in service of the [[Eastern Gods]] that has 7 tails or more is to be hunted and slaughtered.

All this to say, the [[Eternus]] choosing one as a [[Hero]] is unprecedented. [[Monster|Monsters]] have never been chosen to serve the will of the [[Gods]] before, but it seems that such a thing has changed as of now, for this [[Yokai]] has been chosen to serve the gods' will. 

[[Kasumi]] is a [[Kitsune]] who chose to infiltrate human life. She slowly rose through the ranks using her illusions and beauty to charm and captivate targets before having them… accidentally disposed of. While many disliked her, [[Kasumi]] ensured it was because of the facade she created rather than any real suspicion. Still, while many did not like her, none had any real power to do anything about her without hurting their own standing.

Those who decided to send more scrupulous methods to get rid of her would find those attempts failed as her fires could cause burns that would never stop aching as long as they were not purified along with unmatched illusionary powers. While simple in words, these two abilities mix together in ways which leave the targets screaming in agony, unable to find the real [[Kasumi]].

She used this to her advantage when the rebellion started to play both sides of the conflict. After all, both sides were so very desperate for information and backing that it was trivial for her to make both sides dance to her strings. Such games would work out well for her as she’d gain a wide fortune of gold and treasures. 

Of course, she knew such games would catch up with her eventually. And she had no intention of staying in an area where the new empress would bother to get rid of her. So, tricking the naïve [[Nagaya|Kyrin Heir]], she smuggled herself out of the [[Eastern Lands|Eastern Isles]] with her treasures. From there she’d disappear completely under the guise of an entirely different person as she continued to do exactly what she used to, just in a new place. But if the brand of [[Fate]] appeared on her, she’d drop her deceptions and go and join up with these heroes. Why? Well…

>“You want to know why I joined up with you? Well, it seemed like a fun time. That’s all~”
