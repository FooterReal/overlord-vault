Years ago, the [[Elf|Elven]] [[Estoc|King Estoc]] once held love. It was a glorious and sickeningly heart-warming relationship, to the point bards made songs of the many things he and his love did. But those times have long since passed, as his natural lifespan far surpassed his [[Estoc's Queen|wife]]’s. His whoring and grief for the next hundred years is even more well remembered than his relationship as it nearly dragged the [[Sunwealds|kingdom]] into ruin.

[[Estoc]] has little care in his heart for any of his children, expect for the one who was born of that initial relationship of love. [[Alice]] is that hybrid child and she has been granted a sheltered but loving life, to the immense jealousy of most of her family. However, even she is not blind to see how her grief stricken [[Estoc|father]] has degraded. Desperate to regain the [[Estoc|father]] she once remembered and eager to finally step into the outside world, she requested to go on an adventure and it was accepted.

Soon after being let out into the world, she gave the slip to her [[Estoc|father]]’s guards and left on her own to begin her journey, marvelling at what she had missed for so many decades. Although she wishes too, she knows her [[Estoc|father]]'s influence would soon find her should she join an [[Adventuring Guild]] and so has stuck it out alone, moving place to place to truly see the world for all she can find.

The idea of being chosen as one of the [[Hero|Heroes]] of the [[Eternus]] is something she considers a dream, having spent many a nights reading the exploits of past [[Hero|Heroes]] and being immersed in their tales. Should she find the [[Brand]] of [[Fate]] upon herself, she will ecstatically head to the [[Aurora|True Prophet]] to join the [[Current Heroes|Order of Heroes]].

And her presence would probably be a welcome one as while she is not the most effective **Healer** within the world, her specialities lies within resurrection and revival. In her attempts to find a way to bring back her [[Estoc's Queen|mother]], she has become a master at drawing upon the souls of the dead to bring them back to the living. Of course, one doesn’t delve into such topics without finding some…[[Forbidden Magics]].

Said [[Forbidden Magics]] allows [[Alice]] to channel the spirits of the dead and temporarily take their skills as her own, allowing her to set herself into whatever skill set she requires as long as she has the proper time to find the spirit who can assist her. She refuses to take from those wish to be left alone in death however, for both this and resurrection.

[[Alice]] is a rather excited person who seemingly has an incredible amount of passion for nearly anything new to her. Her interest would make one assume she’d have been branded by [[Romance]] but it seems [[Fate]] had gotten to her first. She will take to the job as a [[Hero]] with all of her effort, making sure that everything ends on the note a proper story should, happily. And should she happen to find the secrets necessary to bring back her [[Estoc's Queen|mother]] along the way…well that’d just be perfect.
