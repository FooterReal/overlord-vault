[[Nameless|A man]] who doesn’t speak. While initially such a quality will simply come across as rude, in truth, he has long since been rendered mute and incapable of speech by the his experimentations with [[Potions]]. An accident, but one that was required to survive out within the [[Briar Woods]].

Having lived within those [[Briar Woods|woods]] as long as he could remember, [[Nameless|The Bog-Walker]] has no actual name and goes by the title those who have stumbled across him have taken to calling him. It’s not as if it’s a wrong description as he does often wander bogs. Although, the [[Briar Woods]] are too vast to simply spend all his time within those Bogs. Having a proper name is something he’s never quite put much consideration into.

He is an unusual existence for he lies unaffiliated with the [[Witch Coven|Witch Covens]] which make the [[Briar Woods]] their home but also refuses to leave for whatever reason, remaining within that hellish woods and somehow surviving within it. But just because he is unaffiliated with those Witches, does not mean he doesn’t do dealings with them. For the magic of a witch runs through his blood, branding him as a [[Hexblood]].

Although, despite his status as a [[Hexblood]], he’s not a particularly impressive mage. Enough to send the odd ‘critter’ or two running, he instead relies upon an entirely different method to solve his issues most of the times. [[Potions|Potions and alchemy]] is his forte and he lives within the most varied selection to test these things.

It is undeniably deadly, the [[Briar Woods]] have some top quality ingredients for the art of [[Potions|alchemy]] just waiting to be plundered within them. And that is something which [[Nameless|The Bog-Walker]] knows from nearly a lifetime of experience. Poison, [[Potions|potions]], and cures all fall within his knowledge. The best [[Potions|potions]] of healing which he creates can regrow limbs while typical [[Potions|potions]] of strength can match [[Potions|potions]] of giant’s strength, and his attempts at making some of those have shown a quality beyond measure.

The Ability to grant himself or others impenetrable skin, unrivalled strength, or overflowing [[Magic]] all lie at his hands. An incredible boon, but one that is expensive and time consuming, especially as he now longer will have free access to the plants and reagents of the [[Briar Woods]]. 

He will not even recognize the [[Brand]] of [[Fate]], simply taking it as a side effect of his experimentations. However, when it is explained to him what it actually is, he’ll pack his bags with his equipment and his best potions before heading out to assist the [[Current Heroes|other Heroes]] in this task. Perhaps it will grant him more of a purpose in life than simply just surviving.
