Travel by the [[Seas]] is always somewhat tenuous. [[Monster|Monsters]] live and thrive by attacking caravan ships and regular pirates. However, within the waters is something that hunts the [[Monster|monsters]] itself, to continue to feast upon their flesh and bones. 

[[Allure]] is a rather rare [[Beastman]], as he has a high aptitude for [[Magic]] which happens to be a rarity for his kind. And he puts this [[Magic]] to good use for his hunts upon the [[Seas|Sea]]. For his [[Magic|magics]] involve illusions weaved with enhancements. The more those who witness his [[Magic]] believe in it, the stronger the enhancements which underly it are. For the beast he hunts under the [[Seas]], such a thing makes [[Allure]] an incredible overpowering foe to handle.

While above water, [[Allure]] isn’t the most skilled fighter, beneath the waves is an entirely new story for it is there where he is truly a force to be reckoned with. Adept with a spear, he can flash around the water with unmatchable haste and speed before striking down his foe. His [[Magic|magics]] make sure the target is too frightened or charmed of either himself or something else so that they do not resist his strikes. For those who do not fall for such tricks, he manipulates the water to follow his will to make his strikes more impactful.

Above land, he tends to carry pouches of water for himself to use to hydrate with and manipulate in combat. While nowhere near as powerful there, it’d be a mistake to ignore the hunter as he weaves illusions upon his allies and foes while using their beliefs to subtly turn the tides of combat. While certainly less flashy and effective than his capabilities underwater, the insidious methods of his [[Magic]] slip past notice of most, making it no less dangerous.

To be called upon as a [[Hero]] is an odd thing to [[Allure]], for he has no love for the [[Eternus]]. Or, to put it better, he doesn’t consider them at all for anything. To him, those gods might as well not exist if they are unwilling to show themselves. However, while part of his hunts upon pirates and beasts are done out of a sense of sadistic thrill, he did initially begin to ensure that sailors didn’t have to deal with such issues. Whoever this [[Overlord|overlord]] is bound to be undeniably more problematic for the [[Seas|sea]] with their war, so as is his methodology, a pre-emptive strike is in order.

[[Allure]] is a person who is very much in tune with his more animalistic side. While he does understand more civilized concepts, he just doesn’t care for them and will often ignore them entirely. This will be something the party will have to adapt to, along side his rather cruel nature. While he is not an bad person, he does have many indulgences which he often will take time to enjoy. The brutality of fighting and killing an injured opponent is one of them. Something which may not go down well with some.
