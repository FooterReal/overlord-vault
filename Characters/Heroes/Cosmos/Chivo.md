The [[Hero]] of the [[Cosmos]]. The one [[Brand|branded]] by the head of the [[Eternus|gods]] and is fully expected to be the one to strike down the [[Overlord]]. That…may be a difficult task this time around considering the great [[Hero|hero]] this time around knows absolutely nothing about fighting despite being a rather intimidating presence.

A baker within the city of [[Rhines]], he is actually quite well beloved by that corner of the city for his helpful nature, endless generosity, and good nature. Spending more time feeding the hungry and helping out the downtrodden than most priests, it’s little wonder most tend not to care about his [[Demon|demonic]] heritage and strange looks.

To be chosen as [[Hero|hero]] is something he hasn’t even dreamed of. Who would wish for someone like him to be a great [[Hero|hero]] of legend? He is just a baker after all, not someone of importance. So being chosen as such is an incredibly strange experience and one he is very worried about. He is in no way qualified to be leading these legendary figures. Those around him are bafflingly powerful and despite his natural strength and durability, he is no trained fighter who can keep up with the madness they’re throwing out.

To say he feels inadequate is an understatement but he still HAS been chosen and it’s not like you can go and tell the [[Eternus|gods]] that they’re wrong for choosing you. So he has stepped up to the place of the [[Hero|hero]] for better or for worse.

[[Chivo]]’s panicked flailing is the best he’ll achieve in combat, overcoming enemies with sheer power and size but his skills as a diplomat will more than solve that issue. A calming voice, he is one that is perfectly suited for making even the roughest parties stick together like glue while doing a swell job of ensuring that situations don’t escalate to the point of actually needing to fight.

As a [[Hero|hero]], he will be a complete and utter bleeding heart who will take the time to help anyone in need. It doesn’t matter how they need it, if someone requires aid, [[Chivo]] will do his very best to have it provided to them. This will make him a rather popular [[Hero|hero]] with the people but it’s also going to greatly slow down the speed of his adventure, especially because of the fact that he will search for non violent solutions to his problems, further increasing how long it takes for problems to be resolved. In truth, he’d much rather simply talk down the [[Overlord|overlord]] but he has no beliefs that it’d be possible.

As a leader, [[Chivo]] may cause some disagreement with his more pacifistic methods but he will be sure to address them without fail and ensure the group continues to run as a well-oiled machine while on the hunt for the [[Overlord]]. When it is revealed how flawed his ‘fighting style’ is, there is a fair chance that he will be tutored into a more acceptable state. He’s not particularly great at physical combat, and his [[Magic|magical]] specialities will lie more within helping than harming, but his [[Demon|Demonic]] nature will pick up some of the slack that he has created.

>“Well, I can’t say I ever thought about standing here but…thank you for accepting me as [[Hero]] of the [[Cosmos]]. I shall do my best to make you all proud.”
