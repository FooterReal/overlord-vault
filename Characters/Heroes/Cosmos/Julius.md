The eldest prince of the [[Greyhold Crown|Greyhold Family]] and one that it’d come as little surprise if they are chosen to be the [[Hero]] blessed by the [[Cosmos]]. He is called the Perfect Prince due to his sheer talent and capabilities in ruling, already shown with his control over the domain of [[Frosthold]]. A once desolate and cold land has now been brought to prosperity within only a couple of years.

His most impossible feat is his bonding to a [[Julius' Dragon|Frost-Wyrm]]. A long lost art which most had forgotten even existed. However, the story as he tells it involves the [[Julius' Dragon|Wyrm]] itself initiating the bond upon him rather than having started it himself in any measure. This has granted him an even more impressive skill in ice [[Magic]] and an unshakable resistance to the cold.

Should he be the one marked as the [[Hero]], he will make it a point to ensure that he assists everyone who requires it that crosses his path, doing his duty for his people and others to ensure that they are kept safe during this great threat. His already large support will grow from his focus upon dealing with the issues that plague the kingdoms.

Blade in one hand and diplomacy ready in another, [[Julius]] will solve methods in the most methodical and beneficial ways, doing whatever is required to solve the issue, be it words or blood.

[[Julius]] is undeniably talented in nearly all manner of skills. This talent is backed up by his excessive amounts of effort to ensure that he is not lacking in any form. All matters of [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Elemental|Elemental]] [[Magic]] are known to him, along with mastery of blades and weapons of all types. However, his pact with the [[Julius' Dragon|Frost-Wyrm]] has found it that no matter what, he holds a keen preference towards Ice [[Magic]] and a more aggressive style of combat. Do not let this make it seem like this can be exploited for major gain however. Despite his preferences, he has extensively trained to ensure that none of his skills dull even the slightest.

The Dragon Prince presents himself as an unflappable and unshakable person. Stoic and strong, his demeanor barely changes expect when a kinder or ruder hand is required. However, beneath all of his stoicism, lies the heart of someone who is simply tired. When he has private moments with his party, he’ll often try and find a rare occasion to properly relax with them, unwinding for the short time he’s allowed.

>“Greetings [[Hero|Heroes]]. I thank you all for standing here despite the danger we shall be marching to slay. By the [[Gods]]' will, may we find victory.”
