[[Adventurer|Adventurers]] are a rather common sight among the [[Hero|Heroes]] due to usually having the prowess necessary to catch the god’s eyes and [[Rhea]] is no exception. An experienced and respected adventurer who tends to spend her time out in the frontier, she is an understandable choice to take on the role as [[Hero|hero]].

But in truth, adventuring is more of a side job for her than anything else, something to gather the materials for her true passion. Tailoring and weaving. Common materials have long since dropped out of favour for her, unable to keep up with her ever growing interest in making a true masterpiece of art. As such, she needed more…esoteric materials. But she was neither made of money or willing to trust reckless [[Adventurer|adventurers]] to gather her precious materials, so she decided to take up the job herself.

Being [[Brand|branded]] to fight the [[Overlord]] isn’t something [[Rhea]] much cares for. But there are a myriad of benefits to both going on this adventure and to succeeding which will bring her all that much closer to achieving her final goal. So she’ll take on the task.

And for as long as the [[Overlord|overlord]]’s destruction isn’t major, this is the outlook she will maintain during her time as the [[Hero]] of the party. As busy work. a job. Just another thing to do to continue her masterpiece. However, if she begins to see first-hand the destruction an [[Overlord]] can bring, her motivations will begin to change as she loses her laxness about her role and begins to take it seriously.

Before the damages of the [[Overlord]] truly sink in, [[Rhea]] will simply go through the motions for parts of business regarding saving the world. Her [[Current Heroes|party]] will be treated like the [[Adventurer|adventurers]] which she hired to assist her on more difficult missions, which is to say temporarily allies. All in all, her focus will be more upon herself and her goals rather than saving the world. Once that changes however, she will begin getting serious. Despite being her side job, she is not an A-class [[Adventurer|adventurer]] for nothing and she will place all her tricks into dealing with the [[Overlord|overlord]] properly. Her bonds with the people around her will begin to properly form as well as she’ll no longer treat this as if it’s just something to be done.

And to enforce that ideal is her capabilities on the battlefield. A master in illusion and conjuration [[Magic]], she’s more than capable of mixing the two together to make a confusing and mind melding mess where one is constantly guessing what is real and what is fake. But the Halberd side of her staff does not go unused either. Enhanced by [[Magic]], she uses her illusions to make it nearly impossible to catch the real strikes she’ll make. While she’s a undeniably slow and methodical fighter within close quarters, she only needs one unprotected and powerful slash to take down issues.*

>“So you are who I shall work with then? Very well. I am [[Rhea]]. Make sure to follow my orders to the letter.”
