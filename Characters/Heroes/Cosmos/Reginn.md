During the Reign of the [[The Eighth Overlord||8th Overlord]], it was to the surprise of everyone that the hero was chosen from a base born mercenary. Especially one who wielded a non-purified artifact from the [[Abyss]]. While nobody would question the wisdom of the gods, it was a question of the [[Reginn|8th Hero]] could truly keep up.

With the rising of the [[Current Overlord|9th Overlord]], Her being chosen once again to take up her blade was one made that came with a resounding amount of cheer, for [[Reginn]] taking up her blade once again surly meant that fate was to repeat itself, with the head of the [[Overlord]] sprayed against the ground.

This mercenary is one of the most well-respected people in the world, having slain the [[The Eighth Overlord|last overlord]] so long ago. And while afterwards, she did retire from mercenary work, it’s clear that her skills with her weapon have yet to vanish. This [[Elf|elf]]’s capabilities in combat remain just as deadly as they used too, leaving her an unbridled threat to the [[Overlord|overlord]], having both experience in this role along with the skills to handle it.

As her last role as [[Hero|hero]] showed, she is pragmatic to a fault. While she will take the time to assist others if possible, the life of the [[Overlord|overlord]] is her end goal, making it so that she won’t take many detours to finish this mission. For a more accomplished party, this may work well enough, but a team made up of those who are weaker or more sympathetic than her will find themselves struggling to keep up with her pace, or outright refusing to do so.

[[Reginn]] isn’t much for diplomacy and words, with most of her talking involving threats and intimidation when her newfound status doesn’t end up working for her. But most of the time, she takes to problems with a sharpened edge to cleave any issues into pieces.

While she is a master in most swords, the former Hero has found the one which works best for her is her [[Consumption|Abyssal Artifact, Consumption]]. A fiercely hungry weapon which consumes the lifeforce of those it hurts to restore her own energy. It venomously rejects other wielders and is insatiably hungry for violence.

[[Reginn]] is, paradoxically, both a rather laid back and strict person. When in times of ‘peace’ or silence, she is someone who tends not to put too much effort into leading, letting the [[Current Heroes|other party members]] do as they wish and advance how they want, although she will still take a moment to assist those who are struggling in their goals. However, when she steps into her role properly, it is one she holds completely control over. She expects her orders to be fully followed and disobedience is **reprimanded**.

>“So you lot are the newest bunch chosen by the [[Gods|gods]]? Don’t quite look up to standard compared to my old group but I’ll see what I can do with you.”
