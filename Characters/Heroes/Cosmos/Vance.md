Revenge. A cycle of destruction that typically doesn’t end without rivers of blood to fill the graves of those who’ve died over it. For some, while the idea is sweet, it is something they deny and move on past, unwilling to continue the cycle. For [[Vance]], it is all he has left. And he is going to dull it out. Painfully.

His life before this was peaceful. Ideal even. Away from any dangers, the [[Vance's Hometown|small town]] he lived within was turned to dust. He hardly even could remember the events that tore down his [[Vance's Hometown|home]]. he screaming far too deafening to remember anything else. But he remembered the [[Black-Masked Killers|bastards]] who did it. He can never remove the sight of their [[Blacken Mask|blacken masks]] and [[Odd Armour|odd armour]] from his memory. They were too distinct to ever mistake.

Tearing himself out of the ruins, dying and pained, he pushed his body for days on end. When anyone else should have died, he pushed onwards and onwards with no vision on where to go. And by just as life finally gave up upon him, he stumbled upon it. A [[Daemon]] of the [[Abyss]], just as weakened as he was. Desperate not to die and just as bloodthirsty for revenge, it offered a deal to [[Vance]]. He would seal itself within his body, giving it time to heal while [[Vance]] would be instantly repaired. In return, [[Vance]] would seek revenge on both of their behalf. Such a free offer was easily taken by the traumatized child.

And now he hunts for the [[Black-Masked Killers]] and the [[Demon|Abyssal demons]] who he must strike down with reckless abandon. However, if he is [[Brand|branded]] by the [[Cosmos]], he will briefly stop just long enough to take the title to use to assist him in his task. Then the hunt shall be back on.

[[Vance]] could not care less about the [[Overlord|overlord]], unless he would believe they have a tie to his revenge. And due to this, he will either completely ignore everything else but his vengeance or make a reckless charge at the [[Overlord|overlord]] which puts everyone at risk. He is completely unfit to be a leader as he is. Perhaps, if someone could get him to listen, carefully unweave all of his issues, and convince him to place his vengeance to rest, he could end up becoming the [[Hero]] the people need. But more than likely, he’ll just brush off their nonsense.

A master in [[Abyssal Magics]], he uses the dark magics and curses to empower himself and drain his enemies of their lifeforce to fuel himself. His fighting is brutal, savage, and clearly self taught. Full of holes, it relies on his self-healing to sustain his style of fighting. But it’s undeniable that it’s beyond effective as he’s an incredibly lethal force of nature upon the battlefield.
