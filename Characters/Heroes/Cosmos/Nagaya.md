They say that no motivation burns more brightly than revenge. Others would claim that honour should be placed above all. So it’s by luck’s grace that [[Nagaya]] gets to do both. For his people lie within the hands of a [[Empress Sayo|scheming tyrant]] and his [[Imperial Family (Previous)|family]]’s legacy lies slandered and burned to ash. 

This is an utterly unacceptable situation. Though he has fled to the [[Mainland|western lands]], he has never quelled his ambitions to return [[Eastern Lands|home]] and to gut the bastard who dared to slaughter his [[Imperial Family (Previous)|family]] as if they were cattle in the name of seizing power for herself. But retribution for such a thing seems ever so far away. While they have taken him in and given him and those escaped aid, these [[Mainland|lands]] are not sympathetic to his cause. They have no cause to fight for him and [[Nagaya]] can hardly blame them. Many men would fall in the face of what they would have to fight. To sacrifice so much for a cause they do not know… it would be hypocritical to condemn them for an act his own family had made years ago.

While the aid of his fellow countrymen who fled with him would be greatly appreciated in this endeavour, [[Nagaya]] is not willing to call to arms people who have already given their all. They fought tooth and nail to resist that [[Empress Sayo|tyrant]] and in the end, bled far too much for it. It is clear to him that bringing those so low on will can only lead to disaster. Which means that he needs the support of those of [[Mainland|this land]].

So he has taken up work, with a focus upon adventuring. A brutish and crude task, but one he does never the less. It’s a popular thing with the people of these lands and curries him favour. Beyond that, there are just issues that plague these lands that must be dealt with as well. It’s a method which clears many issues at the cost of himself. A harsh life, but one he willingly suffers for his people.

And as a heir to the [[Imperial Family (Previous)|Kyrin Dynasty]], [[Nagaya]] follows the path of his forefathers and the divine beast form which they take their name from in the art of combat. Capable of creating blessed holy fire, he uses that to enhance his prowess in battle as a force multiplier, although he utterly refuses to use it against a cause or person which he considers just. But he does not rely upon just his family’s holy fire to strike down his foes. His blade work is nothing to scoff at while his capabilities with magic meant to seal and weaken evil beings are something many in these lands will find themselves incapable of countering.

But the battlefield is for [[Fighter|warriors]] and savages. And while he can fight, this is not where he prefers to duel with those who are capable of though and reason. For his best comes in diplomacy. The act of getting others to see his way is one he’s always been stronger with than the sword.

These powers will fully be placed to use in the case of him being chosen as the [[Hero]] of the [[Eternus]]. While his family may have turned down such a title centuries ago, it is not something he can choose to ignore right now. Nor does he wish to. The respect and renown that would come from being one of the [[Hero|heroes]] of legend would be enough that he would be able to rally the support necessary to free his [[Eastern Lands|home]] and take by his birthright. Beyond that, seeing the damages these [[Overlord|Overlords]] can bring will further his resolve even more. 

As the [[Hero|hero]], he will do his duty to slay the [[Overlord|overlord]] and protect the people. However…as unfortunate as it is, spending all of their time rushing after fires to put out refuses to put out the core issue. [[Nagaya]] will not enjoy doing it, but he will prioritize opportunities to strike the [[Overlord|overlord]] and their schemes down over helping the people who are harmed by them, for more problems will arise if they just ignore the schemes of the evil in order to protect them.

>“I am [[Nagaya|Nagaya Kyrin]], [[Imperial Heir]] of the [[Imperial Family (Previous)|Kyrin Dynasty]]. You shall have my support and in return, you will grant your own.”
