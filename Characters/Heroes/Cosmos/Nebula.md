—————————————————
Rarely does a [[Demon]] earn the blessing of a [[Gods|God]], no matter from what religion they come from. But it seems that this [[Demon|demon]] has impressed the [[Gods|God]] of the [[Cosmos]] is some way, having been blessed with the powers of the stars themselves.

Who [[Nebula]] was before his blessing is unknown with him deliberately giving confusing answers whenever asked. And this is intentional, for his past is not something [[Nebula]] is rather fond of. Who he used to be, name, legacy, and all, have been left behind for the new persona he had made now.

For what caused this change was falling for the sickly sweet trap of [[Demon|Demonic]] supremacy, he had spent his youth being convinced that such a thing was true and that they were genetically created to be superior to everything else. Why else would a [[Overlord]] specifically create them?

By the time he had snapped out of the blinding ideals and the honeyed words that [[Demon]] had whispered into his ears, he had already done things that he could not change. Unwilling to live the life of someone who’d do such things, he went to the [[Eternus]] to pled for another chance. And for whatever reason, it seems the [[Gods|god]] of the [[Cosmos]] listened long enough to do something for him.

Should he be chosen by the [[Cosmos]] again, he will ensure that the duty he has been [[Brand|branded]] with will be fulfilled in the utmost way. Which means that nothing will be left behind. Nobody will be forgotten. All wrongs shall be righted and the [[Overlord]] shall be sent to death’s halls. This will be done properly. No shortcuts which can backfire and no risks to the very people he’s trying to protect.

Some people may be belligerent about having a [[Demon]] as the [[Cosmos]]’ favourite but he won’t mind them. He’s seen what prejudices and blind anger can lead too. [[Nebula]] would have to be the world’s greatest hypocrite to decry them for their words when, in the past, what he spewed at none [[Demon|demons]] was far more foul and far more terrible. He will make his very best attempt to convince them with his actions and words, but if that isn’t possible, then so be it.

[[Nebula]]’s [[Magic]] and powers, unsurprisingly, lie within the capabilities of the stars and the universe. He can call upon the symbols in the stars for skills that are far beyond him, craft and create miniature stars to use as weapons, and so much more. All limited to his own strength. He is the limit to the power that can be used, rather than anything else.

[[Nebula]], when first starting out as [[Hero]], will attempt his best to stick to the perfect facade one would expect for someone like them. But overtime, he’ll slowly start to drop the facade and should he find acceptance, show his true self to the people around him. Should he be greeted with only backlash, the ‘mask’ will be placed on and may very well become his new face. He dropped a personality before. He can do it again. No matter how awful it feels.
