When the world shook due to the [[Great Adversary]]’s battles, despite the best efforts of many to fix it, permanent scars were carved into the planet. The [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]] in these areas is incredibly strong, and by some unknown phenomenon, causes the land itself to break free of the ground and float into the air.

The [[Floating Islands]] which have resulted from such has stirred much interest. Not just because of the overwhelming [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]] in these places but because of all the treasure and artifacts left behind. 

The allure of what could lie within these floating islands caught [[Kimer]]'s interest from a young age and despite deterrence from her [[Kimer's parents|parents]], she wished to visit these places in the sky. Day and night, she’d train her abilities to be as fleet of foot as possible. Eventually, she got her chance to put her training to work as she snuck herself into an expedition to an island near her [[Kimer's home|home]].

Everyone else died. Nobody was spared of whatever thing lingered within that island and only she made it out alive due to her swift footwork. Despite this, she remained undeterred from her goal and would return yearly to that island and others to find out if she could indeed best it this time. And eventually, she did and with it, she plundered all of it’s secrets and treasures before moving onto the next in line for her raiding.

If not [[Brand|branded]] by [[Romance]], she would continue her exploration without any interruptions. However, if she is, she will drop everything to go and head for the [[Aurora|True Prophet]], having apparently learned things from these ancient places which spurn her to action without any hesitation.

Quick on her feet, her greatest defense is her mobility and tricky fighting style. While she herself is not particularly outstanding with a blade, her wide variety of tricks makes her an annoying fight. 

But her real aspect shines while fighting hulking beasts and monsters, creatures that are nowhere close to mortal men. Having a plethora of skills in dealing with such beast, along with her own supply of old relics to use at a moment’s notice, she’s a much better monster hunter than a killer. But she’ll fulfil whatever role is needed in this great quest.

She’s an encyclopaedia for knowledge regarding the times before and during the [[Great Calamity|Ancient Calamity]], something that could end up quite useful during their journey as the knowledge of those before the [[Great Calamity|Calamity]] is far more dangerous than the type that exists nowadays.

>“I didn’t expect an [[Lore/Titles/Overlord]] to rise during my lifetime, but ah well. Duty calls for all of us, even the ones who would never expect it. Name’s [[Kimer]], pleased to meet you all.”
