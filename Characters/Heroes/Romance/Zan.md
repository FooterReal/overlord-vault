The hybrid of both a foreign eastern [[Beastman]] and a [[Human]], [[Zan]] was promptly dumped at a church dedicated to the goddess of [[Romance]]. Taken in, he was raised under the roof of the goddess and it very much formed his world views.

Someone who sees the beauty in all things in life, he finds the idea of a ‘[[Hero]]’ to be something he wanted to aspire too. To live through that kind of life appealed to him greatly and so he left the church at a rather young age. After all, all the best [[Hero|heroes]] get their start when they’re fresh.

Having ran off with essentially nothing, he would be forced to make due for himself but it didn't bother him much. He would make ends meet however he could while searching for injustice to strike down! He would not find much evil due to his age and most people being unwilling to direct him towards anything dangerous.

But dismayed he was not. He would continue doing this time and time again as he’d grow older and older. He would start to become known as a wandering helper of sorts. Not someone you really rely on for the dangers he’s looking for, but someone who’d help out with anything that needed to be done.

This would be what he continues to do should he not be [[Brand|branded]] by [[Romance]]. If he is, he’d be both immensely honoured and undeniably excited for being chosen as one of THE [[Hero|heroes]]. He’ll rush off immediately to go and join the [[Hero of the Cosmos]]’ party with adventure in his heart.

[[Zan]] is a physical fighter who focuses more on brawling than anything else. His [[Martial Arts]] are up to standard enough to be considered dangerous but it isn’t that which is dangerous about his style of fighting. With some [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]], he can draw upon his bestial traits to turn into a large [[Kitsune]]. Despite their specialties lying upon trickery and spiritual [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]], that’s not the type of [[Hero|hero]] he wants to be and so he’s focuses on purely becoming a physical powerhouse within that form. Having achieved 5 tails from purely this type of training, it’s impossible to say it hasn’t been working.

While he is worldly, his knowledge tends to be rather scatter-brained and random, leaving it as something that can’t truly be relied upon. However, his true value lies within his personality. An excitable fellow and one who wants desperately to get along with his fellow [[Current Heroes|heroes]], he will be the one to help soothe worries and build bridges between each other. A friendly hand when things get rough and one that will not be assayed himself.

For while he may seem naïve, and debatably he is, he isn’t stupid. He understands how the world works and while he may simply seem to not get the darker and harsher aspects of it, he is instead ignoring them. While some may call him idealistic or foolish, he doesn’t care. To be a [[Hero]] means being the most foolish out of everyone!

>“Heheheh! Oh boy! It’s an honour to be here with you all. Come on! Let’s go be the greatest [[Hero|heroes]] to ever be remembered!”
