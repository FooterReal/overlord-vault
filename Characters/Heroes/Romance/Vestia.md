Selling of one’s [[Soul]] is generally a pretty awful idea. It’s your ticket into the afterlife and being allowed to [[Cycle of Reincarnation|reincarnate]] or stay within a [[Gods|god]]’s paradise. Giving it away tends to lead to some fairly awful fates for people. Yet in the end, if it can be sold, someone will give it away.

Perhaps one’s backstory could shed some sympathy upon such a decision. Perhaps they could never achieve the goal they wished to, perhaps they needed something they’d never get anywhere else. As sinful of a decision as it is, there are undeniable reasons why someone would sell their soul.

[[Vestia]] sold her soul for some magical tricks because she was too lazy to learn normally. [[Vestia's Daemon|The Daemon]] offered her a good booster and she agreed to it without much thought about what it would do other than that she’d be more capable. And really, what’s the worst that was going to happen?

Well, the worst, as it would turn out, is her soul being bargained to creatures outside of the realm. The depths of the [[Abyss]] are far from the [[Eternus]]’ light and it makes them the ideal spot for outer planar beings to make a connection. And the [[Daemon|Daemons]] bargain with such creatures. Or fight them. Unluckily for [[Vestia]], her soul ended up as a bargaining chip in such a deal and her [[Soul]] was dragged outside of the realm, beyond the [[Gods|gods]]’ light.

And now, she has to deal with her [[Soul]] being thrown around like change to whatever being wants to buy it. [[Eldritch]]? [[Fey]]? [[Elemental|Elementals]]? [[Daemon|Daemons]]? All of them and more have had control over her very [[Soul]] and she can’t exactly keep up with the ever changing rules, powers, and ‘severance’ packages that come with such a thing.

On the upside, this has resulted in a varied set of [[Magic]] which most will find themselves hard pressed to counter due to their [[Outsiders|Outsider]] nature. Her knowledge on outer planar subjects is also quite good, although it could be better if she cared to actually learn more about it instead of just relying on what is placed inside her head to fulfill the planar beings’ contracts. On the downside, she has constantly shifting rules and regulations to follow, and failure has already left its mark on her before. [[Vestia]] is not a beast folk. Instead, she was forcefully transformed into this moth form by a [[Fey]] displeased with her actions.

Unless the penalty happens to be too restrictive or dire however, [[Vestia]] doesn’t tend to really take them too seriously. Her [[Soul]] is long gone and she isn’t getting that thing back. She’s accepted it. So she’s just going to ride out the consequences, and the benefits, of this ever shifting debt until she eventually croaks.

Normally, she’d never have even joined up by the [[Eternus]]’ command. But at the time, her contract forced her to and by the time her [[Soul]] shifted to a new owner, [[Vestia]] found she actually kind of liked traveling with these people and so stuck around.
