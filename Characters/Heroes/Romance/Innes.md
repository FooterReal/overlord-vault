If one would listen to the propaganda of the [[Greyhold Crown|Greyhold Family]], [[Innes]] would be considered a terrorist and scum. An odd think to paint their son as, if not for the fact that he ran away from his family to begin a spree of crime and assault upon the populace for their hard-earned gold.

Although, if you asked [[Innes]], and he felt like actually being truthful with you, he’d weave a much different tale. One of a utterly heartless [[Julius|brother]], a foolish [[Alecia|sister]] who is being toyed with without ever realizing it, and a royal family who’s been built upon a mountain of corpses and lies. It’s an incredibly grim outlook, but it’s one that also can’t be trusted fully. Calling him blinded by his disdain for his [[Greyhold Crown|family]] is barely covering it.

Regardless, he refused to stay in such a place with such people and instead ran away. But rather than simply settle for that, he instead decided to take a new approach. Taking over a group of sky pirates, he has made it his duty to raid nobles who he can find and harass the [[Greyhold Crown|Greyhold Family]] in whatever way he can. Although he doesn’t end up keeping most of his treasures, often giving to people he sees as victims of his [[Greyhold Crown|family]]’s actions.

Being [[Brand|branded]] as a [[Hero]] would bring him an incredible sense of joy, for it is something else he can use to discredit them. The word of a [[Hero|hero]], picked by the gods themselves? Who will disagree with that? However, first, he must prove his worth and so he’s ready to go with a heart full of conviction to go and slay the [[Lore/Titles/Overlord]].

Despite his attempts at shedding his royal heritage, anyone can tell that he’s far different from his entourage. Well spoken and wielding an [[Expensive Longsword]] in the [[Greyhold Crown|Greyhold Family]] style, he only would need to clean up his act and look to hide within nobility once again. Despite this, he knows his ways well around evading capture and the best ways to move long distances without being noticed. Coming with an armada of people and several airships which he ‘commandeered’, moving around for the [[Current Heroes|Heroes' Party]] will be done with ease due to his assistance.

[[Innes]] will not stand for any injustices that he can see in front of him and will call for the party to solve each and every one of them. If he feels like they are shirking their duties as [[Hero|heroes]], he will order his men to do so instead, leaving them to walk without airships to take them anywhere. And he won’t budge on this matter in the slightest.

>“The Gods have chosen me it seems. Heh, Those bastards will never see this one coming.”
