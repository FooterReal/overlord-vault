[[Emperor|The Emperor of the Kyrin Dynasty]] lies dead. Their family legacy has crumbled into rumble, their name unfathomably slandered upon by [[Empress Sayo|Sayo]] with no hesitation. They have salted the very foundation that their [[Imperial Family (Previous)|family]] had stood upon and made sure that nothing was left of it but ash and disgrace. It should have been over at last.

Which is why there is only shame for [[Li Mei|Mei]] that she didn’t see the inevitable betrayal coming from [[Empress Sayo|Sayo]]. Despite using her [[Li Clan|clan]] as a weapon, the [[Empress Sayo|new empress]] decided that there will be no need for for [[Assassin|assassins]] in the new empire she was building and would have her [[Li Clan|clan]] hunted down and put down like dogs. Slaughtered to the very last, it is only due to the sacrifices of heresy trusted that she would escape out of the [[Eastern Lands]] and come to the [[Mainland|western ones]].

She has not, however, sworn vengeance for such an act. Vengeance belongs to the living, not the dead, and to throw away her life in pursuit of revenge for corpses who can not feel is the height of folly. Especially as the very target she’d have to go after would be nearly impossible with that monster of a [[Imperial Champion|champion]]. Mei would simply content herself with being beyond the [[Empress Sayo|Empress]]’ power now, although the [[Assassin]] doubts said [[Empress Sayo|empress]] would care even if she did know she lived. As long as she was off of her lands.

With revenge being left off the table, the only option remaining is for her to rebuild. [[Li Mei|Mei]] has not been deterred by the destruction of her [[Li Clan|clan]] and has set about rebuilding in these new lands, taking advantage of their technology, and especially [[Firearms|guns]], to start business anew here. It has been slow, for the rules of the [[Li Clan|clan]] are more strict and formal than what the people of these lands are used to, but they’re growing steadily as clients start picking up more and more. The [[Li Clan|clan]]’s nature to appeal to more than just the killing of their fellow men making them a more popular choice.

Being picked by the [[Romance|Eternus of romance]] is something that she couldn’t care less about. However, many of the new members of the [[Li Clan|clan]] are religious and the people of these lands are too. To deny their [[Romance|god]] would mean digging herself into a pit she’d never be able to dig out of within these lands. With no other option, she will reluctantly join with the [[Current Heroes|heroes' party]] to do her part in slaying the [[Overlord]]. Although perhaps if the stars align perfectly and fate itself decrees she shall have revenge for herself, and she would find herself much more willingly joining this party.

[[Li Mei|Mei]] will be a capable member of the [[Current Heroes|heroes’ party]] regardless of her attitude. Her skills with a blade are nothing to scoff at, and backed by her enchanted blade, she’s quite a threat to put down directly. And while she is no crackshot, she’s quite adept with a [[Firearms|gun]]. However, where she truly shines is subterfuge. Deception is her bread and butter, in combat and outside of it. One should be wary of taking what she says at face value.

With her connections and history within the underground and her skills in lying her way into the trust of others, [[Li Mei|Mei]] will open many doors for the party that they’d normally be unable to even reach, both legal and and illegal. With a more morally flexible group, such a thing could be invaluable.

>“These legends of [[Hero|heroes]]…how annoying that it’d come true before we could become established. Although there is nothing to do about it now. Send news to the captains, they will need to personally oversee their business for a while.”
