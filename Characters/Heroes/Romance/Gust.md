The Frontiers of the [[Trael|Kingdom of Trael]] are rather dangerous, with constant [[Monster|monster]] attacks and attacks from [[Beastman]] tribes/raiders. So it is lucky for the [[Frontiers]] that someone stands stalwart against the tide for their protection.

Showing up unannounced and without warning, this man showed up during one of the biggest raids seem in years by an [[Orc]] chieftain and successfully prepared and led the defense of the [[Trail|Town of Trail]] against the assault, leaving very few casualties upon their side for the sized of the assault, although not without his own fair share of injuries.

Calling himself [[Gust]], he’s stayed within the bounds of the [[Frontiers]] to ensure that those who’d attack the towns of the frontier would find themselves rebuffed. While he hasn’t been able to save everyone, the wanderer has nearly single-handedly saved most towns outside of the border from a raid at least once.

While not particularly well known outside of the [[Frontiers]], he’s probably the most popular person within them just due to his sheer contributions. While he does defend against attacks, [[Gust]] also takes the time to help out however he can. Be it planting crops, herding or taking care of animals, or tending to the ill, he will be there most times to do what he can. And that will be the most he’ll do unless he is marked by [[Romance]]. While he loathes to leave the [[Frontiers]] alone, he knows well enough that this isn’t something for him to ignore.

When [[Gust]] first appeared, he only used a chipped blade to fight off the initial horde. However, over time, the people of the [[Frontiers]] have assisted him in getting some better equipment and the basics of [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]] that they know, leaving him with a wide but shallow skill set. That said, his skills with his sword are very impressive, although nowhere near the top of the measure.

[[Gust]]’s true prowess reveals itself when it comes to tactics and planning. With some proper time, the plans he drafts up are capable of turning very unfavourable tides to his side while keeping casualties lower than you’d think possible. A valuable skill set, but one he’s learned to not make a crutch after being tricked by a [[Beastman]] raid. He’s worked to ensure that he’s adaptable on the fly to make sure that he isn’t caught off guard in the heat of combat. That said, it doesn’t help too much for his planning as he often needs time to properly deliberate to make something miraculous.

[[Gust]] Initially comes across as a rather polite young man, although his nature as a bumpkin does make itself known by his speech. But as you stay around him, you’ll find his desire to protect the the [[Frontiers]] from the [[Beastman|Beastmen]] and [[Monster|Monsters]] is born from more than just goodwill. As one of the [[Current Heroes|Heroes]], he will push the Leader to prioritize slaying [[Monster|monsters]] and [[Beast|beasts]] which threaten people’s safety.

>“Howdy there! It seems that we’re all in this together now. Let’s give this [[Lore/Titles/Overlord]] a proper black eye shall we?”
