The dream of being chosen as a [[Hero]] for the [[Eternus]] is a common one. Who would not want to be a great and powerful warrior who fights against evil? That was the dream young [[Leo]] grew up with. Of course, they were always just dreams. There was no way some simple farm boy was going to end up as one of the [[Hero|heroes]]. But hey, that would have been cool!

But he kept his expectations in check. Even if his dreams of being one of the [[Hero|Great Heroes]] probably wasn’t ever going to happen, he could at least still help people as a knight. Or, failing that, one of the town guards. So he put his best into training himself up and being the best citizen he could be. And in the end, it looked like that’d even be needed as the town would come under siege of some [[Leo Bandits|bandits]]. Taking down a few, he’d make his way to the leader of the bandits where he promptly engaged him in battle…

And lost. Horribly. It wasn’t even a proper fight as the leader cleaved off his right arm before cutting open his gut without a moments notice. Yet, his determination seemed to amuse something. Something which had been watching the destruction without notice. A [[Daemon]] from the [[Abyss]], which offered the teenager a deal. It would retract his gifts from the [[Bandit Leader|bandit]] and grant them to [[Leo]]. However, there would be a simple price. He’d never be capable of being the [[Hero]] when it was truly needed. Dying, the farmer agreed and promptly slew each and [[Leo Bandits|every bandit]] in the city in a rush of power.

And yet the [[Daemon]]’s words would ring true. For when he would regain control of himself, he’d find that town itself had burned and everyone within it was dead. He killed none of the citizens, but he failed to save any of them when he could have. But that didn’t break him. It couldn’t. He would use this power and he would help those he could. And he would. Slaying evil, saving people. He would indeed do all of that with his new power.

…yet when it mattered. Truly mattered. He’d falter and fail. Those he cared dearly for would find themselves dying with him so close to saving them, yet barely out of range. Towns he put so much effort into saving would find themselves put to the torch and raided for one reason or another while he was gone. Again, and again, and again. This cycle would repeat. His monstrous strength and durability would mean nothing as the pact conspired against him to make him falter where it mattered most. [[Abyssal Magics]] and gear would fail to preform when needed, as fate would reap it’s toll.

Such a thing would take a toll on anybody, let alone a man barely on the verge of adulthood with nothing to his name but a [[Abyssal Pact]]. And yet Leo keeps pushing on to help Someone. Something. Even when he fails where it matters most, that just means he can help someone when it’s less important. As long as he can do that. As long as he can help someone, he’ll keep working to be a hero, no matter how much the failures of his pact weigh upon him.

To be a [[Hero]] of any of the [[Eternus]] is a dream come true. But one he worries will mean terrible things in the end. Failure here would mean something far far worse than the norm. There are too many matters when dealing with an [[Overlord]] which could be counted as mattering. But the [[Eternus|gods]] have chosen him regardless so they must have accounted for such a thing, right?

>“Pleased to meet you all. My name is [[Leo]]. I’m a wanderer who’s just trying to help out where I can. I know, weird to call myself with this armor but these are dangerous times.”
