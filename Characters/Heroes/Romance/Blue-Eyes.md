In all lands, there remains one constant. Crime. People exploiting other people to take what they want. Be it within the [[Holy City of Silthis]] all the way out to the [[Wastes]]. It is truly a sad state of affairs which needs to be addressed. While is why [[Blue-Eyes]] is on the scene! While this obviously isn’t his real name, he goes by it to ensure that the theming of the group remains fully intact. Beyond that, telling your enemies who you are tends to be a pretty bad idea.

A bounty hunter by trade, he is a part of a three man [[Dead Eye|group]] involving, as one may guess, others who complete the colour-theming. While certainly not the most renowned [[Dead Eye|group]], they are known for one thing. Their perseverance. Once they have someone marked down, they’ll hunt them to the ends of the earth just to deal with the bounty, assuming the bounty is for a criminal, of course.

[[Blue-Eyes]] is the ranged expert of the group, but bows and the like are just not enough of a statement for his pace. Also they’re not cool enough but that’s neither here nor there. So, he decided to adapt with the times and pick up himself some guns which he then preceded to plead [[Purple-Eyes]] to enchant because he doesn’t know any [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]].

A crack-shot with any type of gun, he still has his preferences for smaller, handheld [[Firearms]] which he uses in conjunction with his [[Belt of Holding]] to just continuously pull out more and more pistols as soon as he’s out of ammo. Reloading them all is a pain in the ass but it’s an undeniably effective method of getting around the inherent slowness of constantly reloading.

Despite being the [[Dead Eye|trio]]’s ranged specialist, he tends to be more in the front than you’d expect, timing off risky dodges to get the opportunity to blow the other person’s head straight off. He fights dramatically and impractically, pissing off his enemies with his obviously mocking style. Although, if need be, he can and will get serious, and when he does he’s quite the terror to behold upon the battlefield.

Being [[Brand|branded]] by the gods isn't something he'd see coming. If anyone was going to get it, he thought it’d have been [[Red-Eyes]]. But, since he’s been chosen, he’s got no reason to refuse. The [[Lore/Titles/Overlord]] is the biggest bad guy of them all and the kind of reputation he’d cultivate for killing them off would be insanely useful.

…also they’re offering a lot of money. Like an absurd amount of money. There was never a way he was saying no to this much for just doing his job.

[[Blue-Eyes]] would want to go after the biggest and baddest right off the bat if he has competent [[Current Heroes|team members]]. The biggest threats with the biggest meaning to their names would be his idea of a fine time. But he’s been in a team long enough to realize that you have to play to team dynamics. If he’s working with more inexperienced fighters, and by god will he know, he’ll advocate starting out with smaller fish to fry as a ‘testing’ measure. After all, it’s not like he wasn’t in their spot before.

>“Howdy Ho! The gunslinger of [[Dead Eye]] comes to lend his guns to this fine task because the [[Eternus' Church|church]] is paying me and absurd amount of money. Let’s knock 'em dead!”
