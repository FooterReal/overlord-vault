What is happiness? That is a question that eludes many people, especially in an age suffering from an [[Overlord]]. Being content or satisfied with you life, comparably, is much more simple than that. [[Wulburg]] would know that from experience. Having grown within [[Wulburg's Tribe|his tribe]], it was very easy to consider it enough for him. The resources, the people, the respect. All of it did bring a sense of satisfaction for he was their best [[Fighter|warrior]].

But in the end? He knew the truth deep within his heart. He wasn’t happy. Not with the life he was living and not with the one that he had. So he would pack up his gear and set off from [[Wulburg's Tribe|his tribe]] for he knew he would not find that happiness there.

He would wander for days upon days, which would slowly turn to months and then years. His initial assumptions that being happy would be easy were broken as time would continue to pass and he’d find no answers. Only satisfaction. And that was never enough for him. He’d travel to cities, religious sites, the [[Wastes]], and even wandered into the hell that was [[Trael]]’s capital city just to see if he could find that answer.

Of course, he hasn’t found it just yet. But this journey has brought him one step closer to that sense of fulfilment and happiness that he truly seeks, so no matter how much time he loses upon this goal, [[Wulburg]] is perfectly willing to continue on for many more years. For happiness is the ultimate end goal for all living things and he would greatly like to enjoy that.

His journey has greatly enhanced his already notable prowess as he’s taken the time to absorb the fighting styles and knowledge from the places he visited. Originally, while he simply carried a heavy blade, he has learned much more about fighting than he could have ever imagine, having built up a foundation supported by a wide variety of skills and abilities. While he is by no means the strongest in any aspect, his catalogue of weapons that he can use is vast and that variety can cover his gaps.

To be [[Brand|branded]] by the [[Eternus|gods]] is certainly an experience that [[Wulburg]] would enjoy experiencing. It’s something that he would never have seen or experienced otherwise. While religion wasn’t quite capable of answering what would make him happy, and he doubts even a [[Gods|god]] would, there would have to be something special to learn from being a [[Hero|hero]].

So he’ll take up the mantle and do so with no reservations. Placing his full efforts into being a [[Hero|hero]], he will bring with him a deluge of worldly experience. That experience, however, is not for exploring. While he has travelled for a long time, [[Wulburg]] doesn’t care much for the finer details of things. Instead, he brings with him the experience of someone who truly knows how to understand the core of oneself. Perhaps not very useful within a [[Current Heroes|party]] where everyone is sure of who they are and their goals. However, for those who waver, his aid would be valuable.

>“I am only a humble explorer. But as your [[Eternus|gods]] have presented me this opportunity, I shall not deny their kindness.”
