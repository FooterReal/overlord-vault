An obvious [[Demon|demon]], [[Eligor]] is rather young, only having been alive for 16 years at this point. 
When he was young, [[Eligor]] was ‘kidnapped’ by tribal bandits who believed him to be an avatar of their god, who actually happened to be the [[Wyr-Ones]].

Not particularly fond of his deadbeat parents, he just went along with that and took advantage of all the opportunities granted by effectively leading a bunch of road bandits. His sharp mind actually made it quite a challenge for his worshippers to be caught. But no matter how smart, a child’s mind doesn’t work to its fullest extent and his trip ups eventually came back and got the bandits all killed and him captured.

Not that he was crying over it. Despite their clear worship for him, [[Eligor]] couldn’t bring himself to care for them. In fact, caring for people has been a challenge for him. He knows it’s possible, with his one and only friend being someone he’d move heaven and earth for but this whole friendship business doesn’t seem to like clicking for him.

Perhaps unaware of all the details or just feeling merciful to the child, the [[Guard Captain|captain]] put him to work in the guards to pay back what was caused by the bandit attacks. Here, he has and will stay for quite a while… At least if he was not [[Brand|branded]] by [[Knowledge]]. If he is, his penance will be lifted and he will immediately be dragged to a carriage towards the [[Aurora|True Prophet]].

[[Eligor]] doesn’t much care for this whole [[Hero]] business but getting out of years worth of work and getting access to more things which could help his craft sounds all good to him. Whatever happens in this mess other than his death is completely fine with him, as long as he walks away a winner.

[[Eligor]]’s unique brand of [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]] is supplemented by his body, allowing him to freely shift and mix the types of effects his spells throw out. Additionally, his body is resistant to nearly all types of damage, the prismatic coating seemingly working for both defense and offense.

Martially, he’s acceptable with a sword and knows the aspects of dirty fighting quite well. Although preferably, any strategies he helps draft won’t see him having to use it.

>“One hell of a mess we’ve been chosen to deal with. But fine. I’ll lead you people to victory and glory.”
