[[Julius]], the Perfect Prince and beloved by most for his skills and talents. A natural choice to inherit the throne from his [[King Greyhold|father]]. [[Innes]], the Bandit Prince. The great shame of the [[Greyhold Crown|Greyhold Family]] and one who consistently is besmirching their name with his actions. Famous and infamous respectively, they are both still well known by the people for their own reasons. And then there is [[Alecia|Princess Alecia]], the forgotten child.

Most people have never really considered her anything other than a spare heir. One that doesn’t really matter because obviously, her [[Julius|older sibling]] isn’t suddenly going to drop out of nowhere with his level of potential and the protection of a [[Dragon|dragon]]. What value she does has is dictated just by her relationship to the royal family.

That admittedly…hurts. But [[Alecia]] tries not to let that get to her. Simply sitting around for something to happen to prove her worth has never been the plan. Not with all the resources left to her. And so she got to work, planning on showing her family just what she could bring to offer herself.

And as it’d turn out, she had quite the talent of [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Geomancy]]. She would excitedly get to work on mastering her [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]] to the point of mastery, with her even working her way into and out of the [[Imperial College]] purely just on scholarships. This, of all things, would have to prove that she was indeed worth something. To her parents at least. She’d prove that even if she wasn’t her [[Julius|brother]], she still was worthy of being given attention.

Her [[King Greyhold|father]] would walk out of her performance halfway through without a word to her. Needless to say, she was absolutely crushed by his actions. Putting down her [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic|magics]], she’s simply taken to fading further into the background. 

If even after all that time and effort, the etiquette lessons, [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]] studies and more for years on end. If all of that wasn’t even enough then it was clear the jeers were right. Some people attempt to use her to make power plays but frankly, she just doesn’t really care about it anymore.

But perhaps the [[Eternus]] of [[Knowledge]] will find more value in her than her family did. Should she be [[Brand|branded]] by [[Knowledge]], she will immediately pick her staff back up and head out to answer the call of the [[Gods|god]]. Her own personal devotion to them coupled with a sense of duty will have her out of the castle doors to meet with the [[Aurora|True Prophet]].

For the [[Current Heroes|other heroes]] she’ll project the image of a stalwart ally and steeled mage. But if one digs below the surface and offers her an ear, they’ll find what lies underneath that. A girl so desperately starved for attention and affection that in truth, her major reason for risking life and limb isn’t for the world’s safety or glory. But just for people to consider her as an actual person.*

>“[[Alecia|Princess Alecia Greyhold]], it is a pleasure to meet my fellow [[Hero|heroes]]. Hopefully, my [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Geomancy]] should serve us quite well in our honourable task.”
