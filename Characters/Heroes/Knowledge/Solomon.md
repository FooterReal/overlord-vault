The [[The Seventh Overlord|7th overlord]]’s teachers were some of the fiercest fighters seen in a long time. So much so, the [[Aurora|True Prophet]] herself was forced to intervene and assist in their destruction. Warbands and high level adventurers were sent in mass to destroy these great threats. 

Yet one got away. A force beyond measure and a master in most branches of [[Magic]]. [[Solomon]] was the first teacher who stood side by side with the [[Overlord]]. He taught him and stood by his side with upmost loyalty when he chose to rise to his station as the [[The Seventh Overlord|7th overlord]]. Yet, despite all of his might and [[Magic|magical]] prowess, his teacher was undeniably a step beyond him. Where his limits stopped, the [[Wizard]]’s had barely begun.

While he no longer looks very spry, he is far older than he looks with hundreds of years spent researching and training his [[Magic]]. His capabilities made it so he could even craft himself ‘[[Immortality]]’. To say he’s a master of [[Magic]] would be an understatement. Any mage capable of damaging the [[Weave]] itself, no matter how briefly, is someone to be feared.

So it’s little wonder that he of all people was able to escape the crusade upon [[The Seventh Overlord]]'s Teachers. Where he went was unknown, and as the years passed on and no retaliation would come form the foul [[Wizard]], people had began to forget about him. Doubtlessly more so when the [[The Eighth Overlord|8th Overlord]] appeared with Her own brand of disgusting sorcery. Still, those with long lives do still remember and keep an eye out for the old [[Wizard]] even now.

…and it seems that he has returned in the most strange of circumstances. Casually making his entrance into the great temple of the [[Eternus]], he would present the [[Brand]] smugly. No matter how many tests were preformed, the undeniable fact of the matter is that he is the [[Hero]] [[Brand|branded]] by [[Knowledge]]. Yet it’s little wonder why people feel doubt upon the [[Wizard]]’s very dubious history.

However, it’s hard to deny the [[Eternus|gods]] have a point in choosing him, for there is very few who can match the abilities of the teacher of [[The Seventh Overlord]]. With mastery of dozens of different types of [[Magic]], he makes even the best of this age look like children. Forgotten techniques, infeasible casting, and far more lie within his hands. Some may say that it’s easier to describe what [[Solomon]] can’t do rather than what he can.

But this power will find itself pointed not at the enemy, but at ‘friends’. Healing will not be granted to those who are in need due to being distracted, spells will coincidentally catch other [[Hero|heroes]] within its blast, and knowledge he should know will be forgotten for a little while. Nothing that can purposely be proven as malicious but unhelpful and risky all the same. For all of his infamous prowess, the [[Current Heroes|Heroes]] will find that [[Solomon]] is just as much as a hinderance as he is a benefit. Perhaps, if they were capable of convincing him to truly take this seriously and help, they would have a monstrous ally upon their hands. But that’s unlikely.

>“So you wish for me to play your games [[Eternus]]? Very well then. But we’ll be playing MY way, not yours.”
