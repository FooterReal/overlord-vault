The [[Imperial College]] is the most prestigious place of a mage to be able to get inside and learn at within the borders of [[Trael]]. There are very high bars (and potentially payments) to jump over to be capable of getting inside. And if a [[Hero]] was to be chosen within its walls, it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise to most. Only the best are allowed inside of it’s walls.

…so that is to say, when looking at mages, [[Lissa|Lissa Yevet]] is what you’d call bottom of the the barrel within the walls of the [[Imperial College|Academy]]. Undeniably talented, she was initially quite excited to enter into the [[Imperial College|Imperial Academy]] after recommendations were granted to her by a [[Wandering Mage|wandering mage]] who happened to be a rather influential wizard, although she never caught his name. But she’d soon find the truth upon stepping into the academy grounds.

She was a big fish sitting around a small pond. And here? Her talent didn’t mean anything. Mages vastly more talented than her come and went with speeds that left her dizzy and she’s barely able to keep up with the studies necessary to stay within the school. Her self taught magics were hardly even capable of keeping up with the rest.

Which is to say, nobody would ever expect her to be the [[Hero]] [[Brand|Branded]] by [[Knowledge]]. Not her teachers, not her classmates, and most certainly not herself. The honour of such a thing would be expected to go to someone like [[Aria]], the most potent caster seen in years, or another one of the many masters that had the honour of being there.

…but instead it’d be her. And frankly, she’s afraid of such a thing. Not for the task ahead, nor what must be done. But she’s afraid of dragging down those around her. The warriors she is to fight with are supposed to be legendary [[Hero|heroes]] with capabilities which outmatch even the strongest of monsters and adventurers. But…she can’t see herself fitting into that. Even with the boost granted by the [[Brand]] of [[Knowledge]].

While she is versatile in her [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Elemental]] skill sets, being able to cast nearly any of them, that is about all she has been able to achieve so far, even if her casting is at a rather advanced level. Her other spells outside of evocation tend to be middling compared to her [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Elemental]] training and even her specialty is something she’d consider lacking compared to who she would be working with.

Lissa will, undeniably, be crushed under imposter syndrome as the quest to slay the [[Lore/Titles/Overlord]] goes on. Despite her best efforts to simply smile and bare it, she will be filled with self doubt about her being chosen by the [[Eternus]] as the [[Hero]] of [[Knowledge]]. But perhaps the gods do know best, for with a guiding hand and some proper words, there lies the potential for [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Elemental]] mastery. Although it will be a long road, it would be one that’d do wonders for her as a person.

Despite being quite personable, while she suffers from the doubt and guilt of ‘stealing’ the [[Brand]] from someone more worthy, [[Lissa]] will be a polite and happy, but in an artificial way of someone who’s simply hiding their problems. Someone with even a mediocre eye will eventually pick that up as the weight lies upon her. But should she get the help she needs to truly rise into her spot, her bright attitude and boundless enthusiasm will bring all the more motivation to the party.
