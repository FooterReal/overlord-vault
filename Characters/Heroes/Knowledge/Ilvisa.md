The [[Briar Woods]], a dangerous place inhabited by some of the strongest [[Beast|live animals]]. For anyone but an experienced [[Adventurer|adventurer]], stepping into those [[Briar Woods|woods]] would be a death sentence as it leads you deeper and deeper in with no intentions in letting you go.

However, those with luck will be stumbled upon by one of the [[Witch Coven|witch covens]] which linger in the woods. Those who are luckier will be saved by [[Ilvisa]] for she is probably one of the most merciful people who walk in those woods. Belonging to a [[Witch Coven|coven of witches]] who have branched off into a form of [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Druidism]], she makes it part of her daily routine to go into the [[Briar Woods|woods]] and find the overconfident fools who believe that they are capable of matching the creatures within.

Should the [[Brand]] of [[Knowledge]] appear upon her, she will debate actually answering the call. She has no lost love for the [[Eternus]] as she is a devout follower of the [[Wyr-Ones]]. However, it seems that their will calls for her to stand with the [[Hero|Heroes]] and slay the [[Current Overlord|9th overlord]]. Despite her reservations, she doesn’t disagree and will set off for the [[Aurora|True Prophet]] soon after.

[[Ilvisa]] is both an accomplished [[Witch]] and [[Druid]] and she mixes together these facts to bring out the most out of each of her magical talents. Her [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Druidism]] and capabilities to manipulate nature makes her curses and potions more potent as the quality of the ingredients added in are far better than normal. On the other hand, her traditional spellcasting is used to enhance the damage nature dishes out at her command.

Her connection to the [[Wyr-Ones]] does not allow her to do anything particularly flashy, but their approval empowers her understanding of her own capabilities along with making it so she learns faster. Her staff, made out of [[Wyr-Wood]], is considered a valuable commodity due to it’s innate magical power.

Perhaps one day, the [[Wyr-Ones]]' favouritism will allow her more should she ever be placed in danger…

Initially coming off as rather standoffish, in truth, [[Ilvisa]] actually would enjoy being closer than simply acquaintances with the rest of the party of [[Hero|heroes]] but simply doesn’t know how. Her social skills are simply non existent, with her only interactions with people being other [[Witch|witches]], people who came to the forest to try and curse someone else, and overconfident fools. Drawing upon the only experience she truly has, she speak to people in a very goal oriented way. It will take her time to properly integrate into the party without a helping hand.

>“I am Ilvisa. Should you require [[Potions]], [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Hexes]], or spells, I am at your disposal.”
