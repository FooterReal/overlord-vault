Long before the spiral of the [[Elf|elven]] king [[Estoc]], and even before he had met his [[Estoc's Queen|love]] or took the crown, [[Estoc|Prince Estoc]] and the upcoming [[Sage]], [[Ayrwn]] were inseparable from each other. With a bond built with years of adventure, these two were closer than [[Estoc]] was with his own family. So much so, that even with more promising candidates, he promised his friend a spot as his personal court mage once he took the title from his [[King Servoc|father]].

This was a promise that he kept upon ascending to King and their bond would remain stronger than ever. Until the King had found love and became so charmed by his future wife that he paid her more mind than anything else. But [[Ayrwn]] was fine with that. His friend was happy and so was his people. So he contented himself with simply being the best mage he could for the [[Sunwealds|kingdom]].

It has forever been his regret for not seeking time from his [[Estoc|old friend]] more. For never seeing the signs before the degradation began to show. For not stopping [[Estoc]] even as he drove the [[Sunwealds|kingdom]] into the ground in his misery. By the time he truly stepped in, it was far too late to truly prevent anything.

Regrets linger over all of his decisions over the last two hundred years. Despite his best efforts, the [[Sunwealds|Elven Kingdom]] is seen as a joke nowadays, one led by someone so apathetic to the world that it’s doomed to fall. And he has no way to prevent to such a thing.

…or perhaps he does should the God of [[Knowledge]] be kind. Should the [[Brand]] of [[Knowledge]] take hold upon him, he will have the opportunity to do something he knows he’ll regret as well. With the [[Eternus]] being the most popular within the [[Sunwealds|Elven Kingdom]] that it’s been in centuries, a [[Hero|hero]] of them may be capable of getting away with overthrowing the current [[Estoc|king]]. As much as he despises the idea, [[Ayrwn]] will do what he must do for the kingdom. His [[Estoc|old friend]] has let his misery bury itself into the [[Sunwealds|kingdom]] and he will not allow that misery to bury them all.

[[Ayrwn]] is not the most prodigious mage. Nor is he have an unnatural affinity for it. However, what he had is time. The [[Sage]] has been alive for hundreds upon hundreds of years. The amount of spells he knows is truly awe inspiring and his mastery of [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic|magical]] theory will be a boon for anyone who practices even the barest [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]] within the party. More than happy to tutor any party member who takes even a passing interest within [[Lore/Powers/Magic/Magic]], he will make sure they are quickly brought up to more than acceptable level.

The [[Current Heroes|party of heroes]] will find [[Ayrwn]] as someone who is helpful. Overly helpful even. Overcompensating for his lack ability to help back at his own [[Sunwealds|home]], he will try his very hardest to help and assist where he can, to the point of burning himself out further. It’ll take a firm hand to force him to slow down and relax.

>“As Fifth [[Sage]] of the [[Elf|Elven]] people, I shall grant my everything to this journey’s success.”
