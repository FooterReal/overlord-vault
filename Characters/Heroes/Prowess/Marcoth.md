Despite the best efforts of the [[Eternus' Church|Church of the Eternus]], crime still squirms below the surface of any respectable civilization. And one instance of such is the [[Blood Pit]], a underground fighting ring that preys on the poor and vulnerable. [[Marcoth]] was one such victim of that scheme.

An **orphan**, he and [[Marcoth's Friends|his friends]] were booted out of the orphanage for being too old without anybody being willing to take them. Left to starve in the streets, it is only natural that they’d take the first hand which was offered to them. It was presented so innocently at first. Simply prove they could fight for some food. And it’d spiral downwards from there. 

Thrown into a despicable blood sport for people’s amusement, the only one of them who had any real talent for unarmed combat was him. After [[Marcoth's Dead Friend|one of them]] died, he made a desperate deal with the organizers. He’d be their ‘champion’ someone to throw around for their amusement and to be placed in fights he’d have no reason to win. To satisfy the [[Blood Pit VIPs|big payers]] who just wanted to sate their cruelties. They agreed and placed him into such matches.

…but he just kept on winning. Fight after fight, he end up defeating someone who should have been well beyond him. The **facade** slowly began to fall as he did truly become the **champion** of the [[Blood Pit|Pit]]. Eventually, he had fought enough to not only buy back his freedom, but he and his friends could live peacefully for at least the next ten years.

But he’s not over the things he’s had to do within the [[Blood Pit|pit]]. Should he be granted the opportunity by [[Prowess]], he’ll grab a pair of cestus and set off to face the [[Overlord]], hoping to right the wrongs he did to gain his blood money and do something actual respectable with his life.

[[Marcoth]] has no special skills. No particular [[Magic|magical]] talents. All he has is skilled boxing which will leave him behind the curve of the [[Current Heroes|other heroes]]. Despite his skills and physique, it will not be enough to keep up with the larger dangers which plague the world, let alone an [[Overlord|overlord]]. What he does have is sheer determination. As long as [[Marcoth]] continues to live, he will struggle against his foes, never going down for long unless his life goes with him.

For anyone who has tricks for him to use to keep up, [[Marcoth]] is willing to train under their tutelage to find ways of keeping up, while being fully willing to train others back in the form of unarmed combat. Despite his rough appearance, he is a rather friendly person who will try his best to help out those he believes deserve it, and more importantly, those who need it. While toughened by adversity, his heart remains soft.

>“I’m probably not going to live up to the legends of those who were blessed like this before, but I’ll try my best to keep up. You have my word.”
