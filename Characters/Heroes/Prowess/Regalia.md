One of the last [[Dragon-Kin]] remaining, [[Regalia]] would much rather be counting the hoard which she has gathered over the course of her life than standing back to back with others trying to fight some big bad. For her greed is enough to rival even the [[Dragon King|Dragon Kings]] of old. 

She tempers this greed of hers with treasures and gold which she wins through various methods. Adventuring, banking, and many other methods. But one thing she absolutely refuses to do is hand off her hoard to other people. She has separated a spending pile for herself that goes untouched by the hoard which also goes in reverse.

Yet, if she is branded by [[Prowess]], she will pick up her treasures and take to the fight. For if there are two facts of life, it’s that [[Hero|Heroes]] get paid very, very well and that [[Overlord|Overlords]] have very valuable magical items.

An S-Rank [[Adventurer]], it’s not a surprise to hear that [[Regalia]] is an incredibly powerful combatant. The [[Dragon|Draconic]] blood running in her veins grant her unmatched strength from the get go, alongside ridiculous durability. Add to that her own training and efforts and it results in a monstrous fighter up front, who is capable of decimating enemy forces with little issue. And that is only harnessing a minor amount of her [[Dragon|dragon]] heritage.

For all her skills however, she holds a major flaw which is known to any and all who even search for a minute, even if putting such knowledge into practice is easier said than done. As of all [[Dragon-Kin]], she is incredibly vulnerable to items which were designed to be used against [[Dragon|dragons]], seemingly having a conceptual weakness to them which can not be purged. But that crippling weakness also comes with possession of a potent fiery breath that burns as hot as the sun. It is fully capable to melting nearly anything that stands in her way. [[Magic]] will also not stop her either as it seems to have issues landing a proper hold upon her, although this trait is more due to her Draconic [[Patron]] than being a strength of her race.

[[Regalia]] is, simply put, greedy to the point of sin. She does not enjoy the idea of helping out others without the promise of reward and will grow irritated with a party who constantly refuse payment for their work. She will argue against such a thing and her draconic pressure even has the chance of making such things a reality with a party of weak enough will. That said, her greed will make it so she sniffs out any opportunity to make money, often leading towards some goal which helps someone.

She is brash and arrogant, but with the skills and capabilities to back herself up. More than likely, she will be more powerful than the other members of that stand in this party, even the [[Hero ]] [[Brand|Branded]] by the [[Cosmos]]. With those who give her deference or have a similar greedy mindset to her will get along just fine with her. She’ll even tolerate those who push back against her or seem to refuse proper payment or opportunities to make money. But someone who does both will find someone who will push back against their every word in annoyance.

>“All that glitters is gold. And all that is golden is mine! So you best make sure that our treasure is split properly.”
