The personal bodyguard of the newly [[Empress Sayo|Crowned Empress]] of the [[Eastern Lands]], [[Cecil]] was her main enforcer during the early days of the rebellion. A simple commoner who truly believed in the ideals [[Empress Sayo|Sayo]] spoke of and was fully board with the rebellion against the [[Imperial Family|Kyrin Dynasty]]. Clad with only an old Naginata, both Rebel and Loyalist expected little of the mud-born commoner. She has no titles to her name, her family were just bakers, and quite frankly, she looked nowhere near the standards of someone of her ‘position.’

Perhaps [[Empress Sayo|Sayo]] simply struct gold or maybe she already knew what she was working with. But the people would only be able to utter in fear as she revealed her strength upon the battlefield. With brutal swings that could send 3 men flying, she easily carved the way for the rebellion’s victory that day. And she would continue to bring it time and time again as the war raged on. For she would polish her mighty strength further and be clad in equipment befitting one of her newfound status.

And In the end, said enforcer’s work would result in the victory of the rebellion and she would be branded the [[Imperial Champion]], the right hand of the [[Empress Sayo|empress]]. This is a duty she takes importance of with no less seriousness than her last, with her training for the [[Imperial Guard|imperial guards]] said to be harsh and brutal.

Should she be called by the [[Eternus]], [[Cecil]] will only leave the side of her [[Empress Sayo|empress]] by her command. With a new dynasty being created, good first impressions would need to be placed upon for the [[Mainland|western lands]]. And beyond that, it gave [[Empress Sayo|Sayo]] an easy way to begin properly searching for those who had ran from their ends.

With her orders, [[Cecil]] will bring her might to the [[Current Heroes|Party of Heroes]]. And might she does indeed bring, as her strength is more befitting of a giant than a human. A swing of her Naginata will tear flesh and bone asunder, carving a deadly path through any force which stands in her way, assuming the shockwaves do not already send her opponents flying. That overwhelming strength has been backed up temperance, for her strength can be a dangerous liability when too close to her Allies, forcing her to use a more restrained and also less effective style of fighting.

As a [[Hero|hero]], her honour will not allow her to simply ignore injustices, especially those caused by nobility’s greed and waste. She will try and find the time to assist those under cruel reigns, either by making it possible for them stand by themselves, or slaying the problem by herself. However, the words of her [[Empress Sayo|empress]] is just as important. She will look for those who had fled the [[Eastern Lands|Eastern Isles]] and force them to sign a binding agreement upon [[Empress Sayo|Sayo]]’s legitimacy or simply kill them should they refuse.

>“The [[Eastern Lands|Eastern Isles]] have heard the [[Eternus]]’s call and the [[Empress Sayo|Empress]] answers. I, as [[Imperial Champion]], shall represent her will!”
