The Grudge between the [[Beastman|Beastmen]] [[Tribe|tribes]] and those who walk the [[Frontiers|Trael Frontier]] is legendary, with blood being shed by either side without abandon. Yet while looked down upon due to the codes spread by their ancestors, some [[Tribe|tribes]] elect to kidnap civilians and [[Fighter|fighters]] to use as [[Slave|slaves]] or entertainment. [[Lauren]] is one of the few who have suffered such a fate. A simple potter, she had no way to fight against the swarm that attacked the small town.

Taken by the [[Blackblades]], she was forced to work for their steel as they continued to work to make a replacement for the lost recipe of [[Godsteel]]. However, her rebellious attitude eventually landed her in the role of entertainment as they would begin using her to test the weapons they had made. Thrown into ‘[[The Pit]]’ as it was dubbed by other prisoners, [[Lauren]] would be forced to fight there for her survival.

Being a normal civilian with little life outside of some traveling, she was not prepared for such a thing. She had to scrape, crawl, and struggle to get out of each of her earlier fights with her life intact, with many of her scars as proof of her mistakes. But survive she did, as she refused to simply bow to their demands of dying for their amusement.

With each fight, she’d begin to grow stronger and more skilled. The [[Blackblades]] were forced to begin using more than just other captured prisoners to keep up with her abilities. And soon, she became a favourite for them to throw into fights just to see if she’d survive. [[Beastman|Beastmen]], [[Beast|animals]], [[Monster|monsters]], whatever they could find, they’d throw at her just to see what she could triumph against with a wide variety of helpful bonuses or detrimental restrictions.

She did not always win, but by mercy, cruelty, or luck, she would at least live to see the next battle. And eventually, such a thing would be enough as she’d make her way out of her captivity. Slaying her [[Lauren's Master|master]], she’d take the [[Lauren's Axe|axe]] which he considered his masterpiece and would make a break for it.

It would be a close thing, with many more of her scars coming from this single incident alone. Escaping from the [[War Camp|War Camp of a Beastmen Tribe]] alone would be difficult enough, let alone with one as battle hungry as the [[Blackblades]]. So, she made little attempt at hiding her escape, focusing on just getting out as fast as she could.

Despite all the obstacles, [[Lauren]] would indeed escape from their grasp. Rushing off, she’d take some time to lick her wounds and prepare. She had no intention of going back to civilization. Not when the [[Beastman|Beastmen]] [[Tribe|tribes]] were still against [[Frontiers|the frontier]]. Instead, she’d begin a one woman guerrilla war against the [[Tribe|Tribes]], attacking indiscriminately each and every one she could, causing mass disturbance among them and placing herself as a key enemy for many.

Should she be [[Brand|branded]] with the title of [[Hero]], she will indeed answer the call. While her faith has indeed been shaken, she used to be a devout follower of the [[Eternus]] before her kidnapping. While [[Lauren]] is unsure of how she feels of them now, it’s undeniable that this is a command that she shouldn’t be trying to question.

While a [[Fighter]] through a through, it’s not hard to realize that [[Lauren]]’s fighting style is entirely self taught and has its flaws in a proper fight. This is because she ‘built’ it to fight overwhelming amounts of enemies and fighting those who are physically superior to her. However, a sufficiently skilled [[Fighter]] will find it fairly easy to break through her guard initially.

>“They would call for me? After all of that?! Why! If they were looking upon me why would they not just he-!….no, calm down. Wrath like that is just going to cause you to be too reckless.”
