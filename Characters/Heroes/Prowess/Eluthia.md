[[Characters/Overlords/Candidates/Eluthia|Lady Eluthia]] of [[Gaul]], a bastard child of [[High Lord Niles]], although that fact is not very well known, and champion of the [[Greyhold Crown]]. Abandoned by [[High Lord Niles|Niles]] to hide his infidelity, she was found and taken in by [[Alecia|Princess Alecia]]. Raised by the royal family, she did her very best to honour those who took her in.

While she would have no future as a child to this family, she took another path to make a respectable name for herself. Picking up twin swords, she worked tirelessly to make herself into a warrior who could champion for the [[Greyhold Crown]]. To this end, she practiced multiple methods to achieve her skills. Tutors, adventures, anything which could provide her a type of training edge.

And eventually, she did reach the point where she could be be accepted as one of the champions of the crown. And there she would remain for years, until seemingly out of nowhere, while praying to the [[Eternus]], she was blessed not only by [[Prowess]], but by [[Romance]] as well.

Due to her devotion to the [[Eternus]], she willingly began training to try and become a paladin and succeeded soon after. For the next three years, she’d serve diligently as the 9th [[Paladin]] while also protecting the crown. Although whispers spoke that she had more loyalty to the church than to the [[Greyhold Crown|Greyhold Family]]. But that would not matter as, during a mission to slay an eldritch cult, she would go mysteriously missing without any trace.

While they would search for her, by the 1st anniversary of her disappearance, nobody truly believed she was still alive. Only for her suddenly appear within the the [[Holy Temple of the Eternus]] within [[Trael]] and simply collapse, as if she had no more will left within her. Quickly brought to the healers within the temple, they’d find her tainted with [[Eldritch Magic|eldritch energies]] which took months to fully purge. 

Beyond just that, [[Characters/Heroes/Prowess/Eluthia|Eluthia]] has changed since her march into the cultist’s layer. She has been markedly noted as being far more uneasy and paranoid, seemingly jumping at corners and shadows from even the slightest provocation. Moreover, even more notably has been the fact she has been completely distancing herself from both the crown and the church. While she still does enter the doors for mandatory meetings, she seems to spend most of her time alone.

Despite her changes, one thing that hasn’t changed is her skills with a sword. Masterfully precise and with incredible skill, it’s hard to match [[Characters/Heroes/Prowess/Eluthia|Eluthia]] in martial combat as her fighting style has you dancing to her own pace to perfectly dismantle her opponents with her blade. If needed, she’s proficient with brawling as well and has little qualms mixing it into her fighting style if needs must, or just going all in with her bloody fists.

Eluthia shall do her duties as a [[Paladin|paladin]] for the party, however nearly anyone can point out just how unconvincing her speeches upon the [[Eternus]] are, as if it’s something she doesn’t fully believe herself. For those who do not care for the 6 gods, there will be little issue, but truly dedicated or those who hold proper devotion dear, questions shall be raised to her. Ones she will not answer.

>“…Ah. I’m sorry. I was simply lost within my thoughts. Greeting [[Hero|Heroes]], By the will of the [[Eternus]], I shall accompany you all for this journey.”
