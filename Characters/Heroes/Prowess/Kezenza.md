[[The Gelistra]]. A group of [[Monk|monks]] who have forgone violence in order to try and achieve enlightenment. They have long died out due to their pacifist ways making them an easy target for evil forces. However, from this branch of meditation and religion came [[The Gelvestra]]. 

[[The Gelvestra]] are just as peaceful as their predecessors but have taken up the decision that if attacked, they will inflict just as much pain back upon their attackers as they themselves take. Honed in body and mind, [[The Gelvestra]] crafted a fighting style made specifically to withstand the damage of attacks and then channel their [[Soul]] to lash back out with even more force then they have taken. It is a risky style, which relies upon a healthy body and mind to function appropriately. But those who can master it are a deadly force.

[[Kezenza]] used to be a part of one of their monasteries. While temperamental, he truly did believe in the workings of their beliefs and tried to temper his anger with the assistance of the [[Monk|monks]] who lived there. And there was indeed some decent progress. He’d work for years to calm his anger and still his mind. The results of which did indeed grant him many revelations he’d have never made before this.

But the peaceful methods of [[The Gelvestra]] would never have lasted for him. Their passive methods for dealing with conflict soon began grating on him. Issues that they could easily solve were left to continue on as they tried talking. And as long as these issues didn’t bother [[The Gelvestra]] [[Monk|monks]], they would refuse to physically deal with the issues. That was just being selfish and lazy to [[Kezenza]].

And so he decided to try and different path. Peace, which nice, would not bring enlightenment and safety. Instead, he would reach heaven through violence. He left the monastery and broke his oath to the lifestyle as he violently beat down those who caused issues near the temple. With the issues truly solved, he attempted to return. Even if he didn’t expect them to accept his choice, he would at least face his judgement with a head held high.

To nobody’s surprise, he was banished from their lands and was told to never return or step foot within a monastery which held their own. Knowing that despite his choices being correct for him, he did shatter his oath completely and utterly, the [[Beastman]] accepted his judgement with dignity and left the grounds with enough supplies to last him a few weeks.

Despite his banishment, he would continue to train his body and mind to further master the [[Reverse Counter Style]] with his own modifications. No longer was it just throws and punches. He incorporated his claws and wings into the style to make it even more deadly.

An [[Oathbreaker]] like himself was something he expected to detract the gods, but seeing as he intended to bring the fight to the [[Overlord]] anyways, he has little issues answering the [[Eternus]]’ call as the [[Hero]] of [[Prowess]]. Perhaps he could teach a thing or two to a willing disciple while he was at it. [[Kezenza]] did wish to leave his own mark upon the path to enlightenment and such things can not be done alone.
