One of the warriors who stood bravely against [[The Fourth Overlord]]’s assaults and died as a [[Hero|hero]], taking down two of his [[Dracolich|Dracoliches]] in a suicidal charge with nowhere left for her to turn. Unwilling to let such a thing go, [[The Fourth Overlord]] took her body and using his [[Necromancy]] and research to bring her back from the dead as a [[Vampire Lord]]. However, she was never released from her coffin in time to help him as he was slain soon after.

Left there to rot for hundreds of years and sealed away by the efforts of priests and necromancers who’s only chance was to help or die, she remains there even now, along with other experiments of [[The Fourth Overlord]]… Or perhaps not. Should she be [[Brand|Branded]] by [[Prowess]], she will gain the might to free herself from her Seal. Upon seeing her [[Brand]], she will be treated with some actual respect and be brought to the [[Aurora|True Prophet]].

A follower of the [[Old Gods]], she is the last person to have expected to be chosen by the [[Eternus]] as a champion. However, while she doesn’t care for them in the slightest, she lived through enough of [[The Fourth Overlord]]’s Rampage to know this is more important than her personal feelings on the matter. 

An incredible combatant with a halberd, her technique with the weapon has been greatly refined over time to be as skilful as possible. But…It is something she’s currently forced to completely re-learn to accommodate her newfound strength as a [[Vampire Lord]].

Her skills with [[Magic]] are non existent, with her only capabilities being her newfound and untrained [[Hemokinesis]]. And while it is an incredibly powerful art once learned for a vampire, it causes hungers which make her feel like she’s losing control, something a follower of [[Janice]] does not want to allow.

[[Hera]] is a rather strict person who takes the business of slaying the [[Lore/Titles/Overlord|overlord]] seriously having seen the damage they cause first-hand. But considering her situation, she is sympathetic to those who are under the [[Lore/Titles/Overlord|overlord]]’s control without a say within their own fate. Those who joined under their arms willingly will find her somewhat less sympathetic to their plight.

Outside of the [[Lore/Titles/Overlord|overlord]] slaying business, she’s a somewhat awkward person, having spent most of her life focusing on herself rather than others. Her conversational skills are not particularly her strong suit and she tends to default to topics she knows. These things are now hundreds of years out of date.

If someone close enough was to ask, she’d readily admit to feeling like a fish out of water in the current times.

>“Yet another Great Evil rises to cause chaos within this world. I may be no disciple of the [[Eternus|six]], but if you would have me then I promise my all in striking down that [[Monster|monster]].”
