Once, the [[Elf|Elven]] [[Sunwealds|Kingdom of the Sunwealds]] was a prosperous place under the rule of [[King Servoc]]. And when his son had taken his place, many had high hopes. Beloved for his heroics, [[Estoc]] was considered a natural successor for his [[King Servoc|father]].

And for the next century afterwards it was proven to be a good decision. A wise and fair king, [[Estoc]]'s only real flaw was that he spent a little too much time with his [[Estoc's Queen|wife]] rather than his kingdom. But people could hardly blame the man for enjoying his love considering just how sweet it was.

But when she eventually passed away due to old age, [[Estoc]] didn't recover from it. Desperate to fill  the empty space in his heart, he took to whoring and other methods to cope, neither of which would sate the hole her passing created. The women he surrounded himself with didn't give him the same feelings she did, and his other vices did nothing but soothe the pain momentarily.

His apathy during these past few decades have seen a major decline in the quality of the [[Sunwealds]], to the point that other kingdoms and people started to make fun of it. And it seems that even the very gods themselves have gotten sick of his behaviour as the blessing of the [[Wyr-Ones]] have been retracted from [[Estoc]].

But none of that matters. Not anymore. These new whispers in his ear are playing him for their own goals, he knows it. But… it doesn’t matter. May he be hated by his people. Let his gods consider him a failure. None of it matters. For he has been granted the most insidious of emotions. Hope. Hope that he can bring back his once beloved to the world. The cost? The lives of far, far too many. Blood spilt on the scale of the [[Great Calamity]].
