Despite conventional sense, even the greatest of evils will eventually draw in followers to their cause, willingly or not. And while the [[Great Adversary]] had no true allies, many tried to follow their will in destroying everything, to various levels success. After the death of the [[Great Adversary]], these bands of cultists and marauders were hunted down to the last.

That is what everyone believed at least. In truth, they continued their operations after feigning their destruction. Doing what they could, they infiltrated even the church itself, leaving them in a better position to move and perform whatever was necessary to stay under the radar. However, their main infiltrator, [[Cardinal Ulfrail]] was exposed by years ago by an inquisitor who worked under them, leaving them weakened in recent years after a hunt was called once again. 

But now is the time to show everyone that [[Lore/Titles/Overlord|Overlords]] are not the biggest threat to their world. Even if the [[Great Adversary]] is truly dead, these cultists have found a way to continue their legacy. They have found a perfectly preserved [[Vial of the Adversary’s Blood]]. 

There was only one person worthy of the blood of someone so magnificent. Their greatest champion, [[Herlas]], a descendant of [[Trevor|Trevor, the 5th Hero of Prowess]]. Stolen as a child, he’s been groomed into a **zealot** beyond measure, there was no other choice but to be granted the honour and it’s one he’ll take to with complete **zeal**. 

His mission is simple. For it is as the [[Great Adversary]] intended. The world shall die, and so shall the universe. Both inner- and outer-planar creatures will be slaughtered and maimed, their bodies torn apart with only a few left alive to watch their world die before succumbing themselves. The [[Gods]] will fall, the [[Abyss]] shall tremble, and everything will be reduced to ash. There will be no mercy and there will be no exceptions. Even he too shall die eventually.

But until that day, [[Herlas]] will march the path of death. Empowered by the [[Vial of the Adversary’s Blood|Adversary’s Legacy]], he is an outright monster in combat. Physically standing up to this overlord in sheer power or speed is an effort in futility for even the most powerful of monsters will struggle to stand up to his power. His magical potential consists of only [[Forbidden Magics|forbidden magics]] but his mastery in these groups is terrifying in it’s own right. But that will not restrain him for long. With his new freedom in learning what his wishes, his prodigious skill, unsurprising considering his ancestor, will be placed to use in learning every scrap of knowledge and power he doesn’t already have. 

However, as a leader, he is lacking. Trained to be a weapon, he lacks any true training for leadership and mostly relies upon the **zeal** of those who follow him. The cult which has raised him however, shall pick up such slack as they are far more skilled within the games that are required to keep an army for people such as him together. 

>“Though they are gone, they have shown us the way. Even now, they bear gifts for us to stand and fight in their place. So let **Destruction** consume the world!”
