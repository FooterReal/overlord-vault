The **Master of the Undead** and one of the cruellest terrors to ever walk the world, [[The Fourth Overlord]] is one who is remembered grimly even till now. However, while pieces of his destruction still lingered within the [[Undead|undead]], it was expected that his rampage was well and done. But it seems that such hopes were misplaced as one of his generals has returned to the land once again. 

Brought back by magic which [[The Fourth Overlord]] had weaved deep into the soul of the undead, it is more than likely that he intended for [[Barbatos]] to continue his life’s work in turning all of the world to undeath. Unfortunately for him, it seems the undead had other ideas. Tearing free from the seal which kept his soul dormant, he took over the body of an armour and slaughtered everyone within the grounds, desecrating the ‘sacred’ grounds with the blood of the priests and warriors before breaking the other [[Undead|undead]] sealed away from their seals.

With his new forces, he has begun marching with a single, resounding intention. He’s going to bring the undead to the table by forming his own kingdom. And if people will not listen to his words and respect his sanctity? Then he will show them exactly why he will be crowned king through violence and rebirth. If he needs to drag everyone through death to achieve his goal, so be it. The [[Undead]] will have their place within this world, no matter how abominable they are considered.

The [[Barbatos|Undead King]] may start small, but his initial forces are made up of the sealed elite of the [[The Fourth Overlord|4th Overlord]] and the [[Ziermaelth|Dracolich Lord, Ziermaelth]]. This will change rapidly as for every battle he fights, he will gain more and more under his cause as they’re brought back as as both mindless and intelligent [[Undead|undead]]. The longer he is left to his warpath, the stronger his forces will become.

But he has no need to stand behind his soldiers for [[Barbatos]] is a fighter of high prestige. Fighting with both the armour he possesses and his own actual spirit, he is a challenge to fight alone as he’ll move in perfect sync. Beyond that, the armour he possesses is the [[The Fourth Overlord|4th overlord]]’s own. Made of [[Godsteel]], a material lost with the death of the [[Old Gods|Old God]], [[Gultiver]], it’s an impossibility to properly destroy without a weapon of equally divine status or a cursed weapon of the [[Abyss]]. Even if his armour should be torn apart, his spirit would then need to be destroyed to truly place the [[Lore/Titles/Overlord]] down. 

He is not a kind king, but he not a tyrant. If the living offers fealty and respect to him, they shall be left alive and under his protection. Though he holds clear preference to the [[Undead|undead]], the living will be provided for as long as they provide for the kingdom he makes. Those who stand against him shall be slaughtered just as any other would.

> “Hear my words, Slaves of the [[Eternus]]! My master has made his mark upon this world and so shall I! You will acknowledge us or you shall die! Make your choice now or regret it in death!”
