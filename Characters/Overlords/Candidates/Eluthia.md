[[Characters/Overlords/Candidates/Eluthia|Lady Eluthia]] of [[Gaul]], a bastard child of [[High Lord Niles]], although that fact is not very well known, and champion of the [[Greyhold Crown]]. Abandoned by [[High Lord Niles|Niles]] to hide his infidelity, she was found and taken in by [[Alecia|Princess Alecia]]. Raised by the royal family, she did her very best to honour those who took her in.

While she would have no future as a child to this family, she took another path to make a respectable name for herself. Picking up twin swords, she worked tirelessly to make herself into a warrior who could champion for the [[Greyhold Crown]]. To this end, she practiced multiple methods to achieve her skills. Tutors, adventures, anything which could provide her a type of training edge.

And eventually, she did reach the point where she could be be accepted as one of the champions of the crown. And there she would remain for years, until seemingly out of nowhere, while praying to the [[Eternus]], she was blessed not only by [[Prowess]], but by [[Romance]] as well.

Due to her devotion to the [[Eternus]], she willingly began training to try and become a paladin and succeeded soon after. For the next three years, she’d serve diligently as the 9th [[Paladin]] while also protecting the crown. Although whispers spoke that she had more loyalty to the church than to the [[Greyhold Crown|Greyhold Family]]. But that would not matter as, during a mission to slay an eldritch cult, she would go mysteriously missing without any trace.

While they would search for her, by the 1st anniversary of her disappearance, nobody truly believed she was still alive. Only for her suddenly appear within the the [[Holy Temple of the Eternus]] within [[Trael]] and made a declaration to the faces of everyone. She would tear down the false gods of the [[Eternus]], destroy their legacy, and slay the greatest evil known to man, [[Aurora|The Prophet of the Eternus]]. She gave the priests and people of the city a day before she returned to raze the temple to the ground.

Some believed she was overtaken by madness or was making empty threats. She was not. For exactly a day later, she returned to make good on her promise. The [[Holy Temple of the Eternus|temple]] was razed to dust and their holy grounds were defiled. Before leaving, she left one resounding statement. She will gladly accept anyone who will stand against this evil and any who stay away from this conflict will be left alone.

Empowered by two gods, Eluthia is resolute to use that very power to kill the gods who have granted her such power. But her prowess is even beyond what she showed before she disappeared so many years ago. Skills honed to perfection have gone even beyond that, revealing a terrifying enemy which can hardly be matched in matters of martial combat. While she is not much for [[Magic]], she picked some up as well, using minor blessings to enhance herself and others while assisting the injured.

Her otherwise peaceful disposition has left many in conflict on what to do with and against her. The places which she attacks are left standing as long as they’re not religious capitals and the people who do not stand against her are left alive and well. But regardless, she has been [[Brand|branded]] [[Overlord]] and heretic of the highest order and is to be put to death.

>“Just as you are, I was blinded by their radiance and promises. But I’ve seen the truth now. I ask this of you as a personal favour from the girl you once knew [[Archbishop]]. Step aside and let me do this without blood.”
