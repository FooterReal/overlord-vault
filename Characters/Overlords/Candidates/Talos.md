What is the purpose of a [[Golem]]’s existence? To work and obey the control of those who created them. That is the purpose of the elements brought to life. Perhaps, once upon a time, such creatures would come from another plane, but they have long since been locked out of [[The World]], with what remains being a mindless workforce, be it for labor or combat.

What quantifies something as alive? The breath of the [[Cycle of Reincarnation]] is generally considered the major sign of something being alive. Ergo, the existence of a soul. However, [[Demon|demons]] are artificially made and lack such a thing, making the answer to such a question unclear.

What is required to be a [[Gods|god]]? Power can not qualify what a divine being should be, unless the [[Great Adversary]] be considered a [[Gods|god]] above all. It is not faith, for the [[Old Gods]] rose from nothing to their status. Then it must be a simple fact of being. They exist, and therefore are a [[Gods|god]].

Does [[Talos|Talos I]] count as an existence? Conventional wisdom would say no. I don't even qualify for being alive. But I continue to exist. And ponder. If a [[Gods|god]]’s existence comes from their state of being, does this not make me a [[Gods|god]]? Life is no longer simple and binary, the bounds of what should be shutter. If to exist is to be a [[Gods|god]], then that states that logically, I too could quantify as a [[Gods|god]]. All that's required is that final push. For as a [[Golem]], I can't be allowed such things. But as a [[Gods|god]], **I grant myself permission to exist.**

Hear my gospel and listen to my words. A new divinity walks these lands and it is time for me to show myself to all. The [[Eternus|gods of the Eternus]] claim me [[Overlord]] for having broken my shackles, but this is because they are afraid. They have seen life grow beyond them and they fear it.

Do not be afraid of such changes. Divinity as pure as I hold now may be far beyond what you may achieve, but there lingers greatness that can be taken in from each of you. No matter what kind of being you are, you can be remade into something truer. Purer that what limits you now.

Stand not below me, but beside me as I march to prove my point. They fear what true divinity looks like, and it means that they shall oppose us with their very hearts. Fear not their wrath, for I will walk the path with you. Rise and be returned my [[Prophet|Prophets]], for your words shall herald a new dawn. Stand from beyond where you stand, those who follow my gospel, and break that sky that my [[Prophet|Prophets]] shall open for you.

>"Do not tear your focus away from the truth. Do not let false belief guide your path. Become true to yourself and as such, truly exist."
