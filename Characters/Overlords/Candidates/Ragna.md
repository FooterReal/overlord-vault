It has been several months since the [[Overlord]] was announced by the [[Eternus|gods]]. The [[Current Heroes|heroes]] have been chosen and they have set off on their task. Such a terrible threat should mean the chaos and war that typically comes with an [[Overlord]]. And yet, that’s not what happened.

Instead, it’s been quiet for several months. Many wonder if the [[Overlord]] is already dead, or if something went wrong. Nothing at all happened which could be linked to a true [[Overlord]], although the people are left upon their toes by a couple pretenders who have attempted to call themselves the [[Overlord]]. These lies will eventually falter.

Because in truth, the actual [[Overlord]] was never really ready for this. In fact, he was hoping for several more years before even considering trying anything and was extremely distraught to find that the [[Eternus|gods]] decided to brand him so early on. But there truly was nothing for it. [[Ragna]] had been hiding the fact he’s [[Overlord]] for months now at this point. 

And now? Well he’s still not as ready as he’d ever want to be, but now it’s time to start taking subtle action as he prepares for his entrance, and there will be a proper entrance. And you, his important [[Ragna's Honor Guard|Honor Guard]] and teachers, shall assist him in such. It’s time to begin setting the stage for his glorious initial march.

[[Ragna]] isn’t very powerful. But what he does have is talent. A great amount of talent you have been nurturing for the past few months. And while he is rapidly growing to the point he’ll outclass you eventually, your teachings have clearly taken their mark for his style of fighting and diplomacy. It will probably continue to change even more, for at the moment, he is quite malleable.

But when he is ready, then the campaign shall begin. For [[Ragna]] has but one goal upon his mind. Complete and utter domination. Every land and every kingdom which is under the sky shall be his to rule. Sure, he has literally no claim to it at all as a simple bastard child but that doesn’t really matter. If [[The World]] doesn’t wish to hand over their lands then he’ll just do what he must and seize it from under them, be it by force or by word. It doesn’t matter too much to him.

And while you are currently his only real allies at the moment, he very much intends to change that. Of course, he doesn’t really have the platform at the moment to be recruiting people himself so that’ll have to be left up, mostly, to his [[Ragna's Honor Guard|Honor Guard]]. But when the stage is set, he will be right there in the front, leading his plan with more than enough motivation to conquer the world.

>“It is time for a change to be placed and it will be by my hand that such a thing happens. Stand with me now and witness the rise of a new dominion!”
