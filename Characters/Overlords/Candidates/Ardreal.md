Life is inherently unfair. That is just something people will have to accept. Others will be born with more or better than one another and that is just simply an undeniable fact. [[Ardreal]] had long since accepted such a fact. It is simply the way of the world. But what he would not accept, and can not accept, is that such inherent unfairness lasts even beyond the lifetime of people.

[[Demon|Demons]], created to be bodies to throw at their enemies. Soulless husks who will die for good immediately upon losing their life. Once, he searched for a method to to grant themselves a soul. To give them a life beyond just the one they lived then. Perhaps the mockery and drivel would cease if they could show that they were just the same as the other living races, regardless of their origins. And you know what? He did. It took him years of research and adventuring, gaining a rather famous name for his deeds. However, the method? Unrepeatable in every sense of the word. Trying to do so would be an effort in futility. But he did it. He gained a soul. He was alive in the same way as they were.

[[The World]] preceded to strip him of that notion. Most people refused to believe him, and those that did didn’t seem to change much on how they treated [[Demon|demons]]. A few did, sure, but overall the reception was just so… resistant. And as years have passed on, he began to get more and more jaded over this. They refused that he could be like them. As if even the very idea was a plague to be avoided.

If that was so, then there was only one way to balance the playing grounds of life. If people would not care to try and help even the grounds by lifting [[Demon|demons]] up, [[Ardreal]] would make sure that they all would stand upon the same ground regardless. He would find the [[Eternus]] Gods of [[Knowledge]] and [[Fate]] and he would kill them, usurping their places as gods and taking control of the cycle of rebirth.

That is his ultimate goal. The upheaval of the cycle of reincarnation, where he will destroy it entirely, take the place of the gods, and ensure that each and every mortal life will live only one time. All souls, both living and dead, will be given one last cleansing before the destruction of the cycle and then that will be it. From there, he will preserve the system, preventing any fool who believes themselves to be beyond death.

To achieve this goal, he took the very soul he worked so long upon and made it into a weapon. Rending it asunder, he used it to forge a [[Ardreal's Rifle|rifle and 7 unique bullets]], each with earth shattering effects. An artifact in all but official decree, this weapon alone is already a monstrous thing in terms of power and effectiveness and is far beyond the normal mechanically capabilities of current firearms. But with one of the 7 bullets, the target on the otherwise is nearly guaranteed to go and meet their end. The perfect weapon to kill a [[Gods|god]].

[[Demon|Demonkind]] will find themselves divided upon supporting him but everyone else will have little issues marking him as their enemy. The [[Cycle of Reincarnation]] is something that has stood even before the [[Wyr-Ones]]’ and all [[Gods|gods]] hold such a thing sacred, lest their followers' souls be lost forever. That doesn’t matter to [[Ardreal]] though. History will find itself wiped clean from the mind of each and every creature in the final wash. Nobody will remember what happened in this age and all who died will be granted their one last life. So he’ll fight and kill whatever is needed to make this final cycle happen.

>“The cycle shall end. For if they refuse to help us up to their level, I shall make them sink down to ours.”
