The appearance of the [[Current Overlord|9th Overlord]] was one which shook the entire world and made it nearly one of the most feared and hated beings in the land. Tearing itself out of the [[Abyss]], [[Maliagor]] destroyed not only the [[Holy City of Silthis]], but the [[Holy Temple of the Eternus]]… as well as slaying the [[Aurora|True Prophet]].

Instantly making itself the greatest enemy in the land, beyond even the other [[Lore/Titles/Overlord|Overlords]] in history, the people wait in fear to see what it’s next move was going to be as they prayed the [[Current Heroes|heroes]] would get ready quick enough to prevent it’s next massacre. Yet…it has not been see in a long time. It has been months at this point and while it is known that it has been [[Brand|branded]], nobody has found him yet. And this has sent waves of paranoia through the people.

But in truth, those who would assist the overlord would know the full story. [[Maliagor]] CAN’T do anything at the moment. It’s attack upon the city was the most powerful he’s been in hundreds of years. And yet it has burned through everything making sure that [[Aurora]] is dead and gone for good, unable to be brought back to life.

This is somewhat odd considering that it’s plans do not involve the [[Eternus]] at all but he insisted that such a thing was necessary to his ultimate victory. The true plan now is to kill the remaining [[Old Gods]] and regain the [[Maliagor's Heart|Abyssal Artifact]] which granted them godhood, tainting it back to it’s original state. The few who work for it will be granted the opportunity to take in it’s power briefly before he consumes it to where it once belongs.

For in truth, the [[Maliagor's Heart|Abyssal Artifact]] the Old Gods left with was his heart. While they believed him slain after removing it, the [[Maliagor|Dragon]] would not fall so simply. Having bided it’s time for so long, it is now time for it to take back what is it’s own. And more importantly, take interest for that. For he will tear a large part of the world into the abyss for the crime of daring to steal from him.

Barely anyone will stand with such a beast, but he doesn’t need many allies. What he requires is steadfast and loyal people who will gather him abyssal objects to restore enough of his power that a proper assault can be done against the [[Old Gods]]. Betrayal would be all too easy right now but would achieve nothing….

Surprisingly for a creature of the [[Abyss]], this [[Lore/Titles/Overlord]] will treat those who stand by him with dignity and respect. A far cry compared to how dismissive he is about the other creatures who exist in the world. Should you follow through with your end of the bargain, this dragon will rend heaven and earth to fulfil it’s end of things.

> "Those arrogant fools believe they can simply move past their theft. I will remind this world that the [[Abyss]] is not simply their trampling grounds for power."
