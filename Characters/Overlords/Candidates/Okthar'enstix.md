[[Aberrations]]. Creatures and things that should be hated or reviled as they are considered beings who do not belong within this [[The World|world]]. Hunted down by the [[Eternus' Church|church]] whenever one slips past the [[Eternus]], they are creatures to be destroyed on sight, no matter who or what you serve, for they bring with them an evil which should not be in this [[The World|world]]. Carrying fragments of [[Eldritch Gods]], they are to be rebuked before they can spread their evil.

Yet it seems this [[Aberrations|Aberration]] heralds a different goal from most of it’s kind. Rather than try and bring the glory of those old and horrific beings, it has come specifically because it does not believe that the magnitude of the [[Eldritch Gods]] are being taken seriously enough by the people here. They treat them as a threat, yes. But they do not know why they should treat them as such.

As such, they’ve broken past the boundaries of the gods, just barely making it past, and has taken a form which is as close to humanity as possible to not send potential followers running to the hills. Knowing their name is nearly unpronounceable by humans, ‘she’ has elected to simply be called [[Okthar'enstix|Stix]] by her followers. 

Having intentionally alerted the [[Eternus]] and making sure that they would find ‘her’ enough of a threat to brand her the [[Overlord]], ‘she’ has made it ‘her’ task to cross the world and ensure that by the end of this all, they will truly know why they should fear and revile [[Eldritch Gods|the gods from beyond]] with all of their being.

Unsurprisingly, considering their origins, [[Okthar'enstix]] is scarily adept at working at unravelling the minds and sanity of those who stand against them, causing intense madness which can drive targets to do unthinkable things. But mind manipulation is not their only tricks, as they are quite adept in using [[Eldritch Magic|eldritch power]] in ways that deny how all known [[Magic]] says should be possible, probably due to their inherent nature as an [[Aberrations|eldritch creature]]. Tears in reality, teleportation, and many other forms of abilities lie in the palm of their hands.

…and yet they won’t grant most of these to their followers. In fact, while those who follow [[Okthar'enstix|Stix]]’s will are granted knowledge of how to draw upon the [[Eldritch Magic|powers of the beyond]], ‘She’ is very restrictive about what people are allowed to know and strictly forbids anyone but the most experienced and powerful from even considering making pacts with eldritch beings or even [[Eldritch Gods|gods]]. Safety, oddly enough, is ‘her’ biggest concern with the spread of this knowledge. For ‘she’ preaches not of submission to these [[Eldritch Gods|gods]], but to leave them beyond your notice for most. Tapping into [[The Beyond]] is risky but it is not that dangerous, but calling upon the attention of others is a death sentence or much, much worse for an ill prepared fool.

Admittedly, [[Okthar'enstix]] doesn’t really have a end goal per say. While they know what they wish to accomplish, they do not have any ending act to seal such a deal. These lands are so much different from [[The Beyond]], and ‘conventional’ knowledge 'she' has isn’t useful here, where the rules are so much different. Some of the time, 'she' is simply going blind, just making shit up on the way.

But to those who follow ‘her’ will find someone who seems unflappable at the circumstances that come 'her' way. It’s a reassuring thing as the [[Current Heroes|Heroes]] and various groups make their counter against their group. In truth though, this is simply because [[Okthar'enstix]] doesn’t really understand human emotions and is forced to rely upon copying others around themselves while they try and accumulate to actually feeling such things. While they often fail, it leaves a sense of unshakable confidence, for when she speaks and fails, it simply sounds like she’s stating facts, not boasts.

>“Do not peer past the veil that those above you have placed to protect you. Look, feel, and understand the horrific powers of [[The Beyond]] and understand first-hand why what the [[Eternus|Restored Gods]] do is a blessing for your people. And then show those who do not understand the truth of what you have learned.
