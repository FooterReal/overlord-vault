Long before the [[Great Calamity]], there were three types of dragonoids. [[Dragonborn|Dragonborns]], [[Half Dragon|Half Dragons]], and the [[Dragon-Kin]]. Their existence was a tenuous one, with each other barely tolerating each other in their reach for superiority in the eyes of their progenitors, true [[Dragon|dragons]].

This all eventually changed when the [[Half Dragon|Half Dragons]] decided they had enough and ignited the spark of war to see which of them was truly worthy of the attention of [[Dragon|dragons]]. A truly pointless endeavour.

The war rage for nearly a dozen years, before a [[Unknown Dragonborn|Dragonborn]] finally deployed their secret weapon to emerge victorious. For the entire conflict, they had been secretly collecting the souls of the dead, fuelling their [[Orb of Power|orb of power]] enough so that they’d turn themselves into not just a [[Lich|lich]], but a [[Dracolich|dracolich]]. Even if dead, he would become a [[Dragon|dragon]] and prove his superiority to them all.

This, predictably, backfired. The vengeful souls held within the [[Orb of Power|orb]] consumed his own as he tried to use it for his ritual and it was left dormant for centuries. History would fly by with it remaining buried and forgotten. The [[Great Calamity]] would pass and nothing would trigger it. In the end, it seemed like despite all the sacrifices needed to make the weapon work, it would go unused.

Or at least, it should have. Until a curious [[Adventurer|adventurer]] stumbled somewhere they shouldn’t have. Not understanding [[Draconic]] in fully but understanding just enough to follow its instructions, their greed blinded them and they attempted to preform the ritual. But time had worn down even the most prepared of items and its original purpose had been destabilized.

As the ritual backfired and his soul was torn from his body, he was met with a different fate. Rather than being viciously torn apart, as the dragonborn who had begun this once was, he instead merged together with the intent of the souls lingering in the [[Orb of Power|orb]]. And with it came an intense and unending rage.

So many different motivations and so many different goals left this amalgamation of souls mad. Its goals changed weekly, with the intention of killing all [[Dragon-Kin|dragon-kin]] remaining one day to ensuring that the [[Gods|gods]] die so [[Dragon|dragons]] are on top afterwards. But no matter what, there is one consistency. It’s actions are dangerous and brutal, brought about by sheer rage and vengeance.

Its final goal, however, will remain the same no matter where whimsy leads it. To be the most important and power draconic being to exist. The will of the souls push for such a thing and there is only one way to achieve that. To have its soul be more powerful than any other. It must consume all traces of [[Draconic Power]] and then scale the skies to show the world its glory. [[Gods]], [[Demon|demons]]. None of them will be as important as it. Anything which gets in its way of doing so will simply be more fuel for the pyre when they die.
