The [[Eastern Lands]] are not very well known to the [[Mainland]], being rather isolationist. However, one thing is known for sure. And that is that these lands are turbulent. Their [[Demon|Demons]], far different from your own, rampage mindlessly across their nation while rebellion rages against the [[Imperial Family]]. 

And recently, the rebels have indeed succeeded in their task. They have overthrown the [[Imperial Family|Kyrin Dynasty]] and have placed their leader, [[Empress Sayo|Sayo]] within the spot of empress. Such things should not be of any importance to you all… but it seems that one nation has not sated her interests. Having captured a port city, it seems like war may be inevitable. Especially with the newfound mark upon her that decrees her end.

In truth, while the idea of taking more territory for her people appeals to her, [[Empress Sayo|Sayo]] has pushed into the [[Mainland]] for another reason. Several important figures have escaped their end during the rebellion. People she can not allow to live. Attempts to have them tracked down and assassinated by her [[Shinobi]] have all failed. So she’s been forced to resort to more drastic measures to ensure that they die. 

That said, while she is here to conquer and murder, she has no intentions of putting things to the torch. Her objective is to carve herself a very large swath of this land for her people and ensure that those who escaped their fate return to it. Most importantly, the last [[Emperor's Son|son]] of the former [[Emperor]]. She has no qualms caring for and taking over in the prosperity of those she takes over and has more than enough coins to afford mercenaries' prices for this task.

While she is not particularly powerful herself, she has not only just an army behind her, but an entire nation. As the only ruler in the [[Eastern Lands]], most bow to her rule even with some cells of rebellion. More than that, she’s a master diplomat, capable of weaving her words in just the right way for nearly any situation. And should she need defense, the [[Imperial Guard]] and their [[Cecil|champion]] cover that duty more than enough. 

A ruthless opportunist, [[Empress Sayo|Sayo]] will be taking full advantage of the people and items that she can within these new lands. Mercenaries will be hired for new coin, excavation shall dig out old treasures from before the calamity, and their technology will be adapted and used as best as it can. She will obviously have to discredit the [[Eternus]] but she is more than willing to try and get the other gods to join her mission, promising renewed places for their faith, one no longer dominated by the [[Eternus]]’s grasp. 

> “So, their gods [[Brand|brand]] me as their [[Lore/Titles/Overlord]]? How ridiculous. Prepare me a diplomat for those [[Current Heroes|Heroes]]. Let us see if we can convince them to join us before we rise to violence. As for the rest? Prepare a strike force for this City of [[Legeas]]. Let us see if they’ll back off with enough force.”
